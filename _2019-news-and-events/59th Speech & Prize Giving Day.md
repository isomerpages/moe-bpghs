The school’s 59th Speech and Prize-Giving Day took place on Thursday, 25 April, 2019, 10.30 am at School Multi-purpose Hall. This year, our Guest-of-Honor was our SAC member, Mr. Goh Peck San.

  

This formal occasion, attended by all staff, serves to celebrate the achievements of the school and recognize the hard work and contributions of our students, staff and partners who have made the achievements possible.

  

The SAC and MOE Long Service Awards were also presented on this occasion. This year, 24 of our colleagues, both EOs and EASes, received the MOE Long Service Award, and 10 of our colleagues received the SAC Long Service Award.
