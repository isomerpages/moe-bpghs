International Friendship Day (IFD) is one of the four National Education (NE) events commemorated in all Singapore schools in April. The aim is to encourage our youths to continue actively deepening the connection with our neighbours by empowering them in this process of celebrating our vibrancy and building our community.

The theme for this year’s International Friendship Day (IFD) is Connected Communities: Globalisation which refers to the opportunity to appreciate and live together with friends from different traditions, languages, cultures and histories. Based on the theme, the main highlight of the commemoration is the morning assembly program on 8th of April. The Secondary 3 NE ambassadors had worked very hard over the previous two weeks to do research, craft the script and rehearse the role-play presentation. In this presentation, the student audience followed the journey of some Secondary 4 BPian “explorers” who just graduated and had very few ideas about what they wanted to do when they become working adults. Through observing five situations, these BPian explorers learned about what was out there in the world for them and how Singapore gave as well as gained from the world.

In the first situation, BPian explorers encountered a newscaster interviewing a Chief Analyst from a bank about emerging markets of the world and how Singapore can benefit economically from globalisation. In the second situation, they encountered a university undergraduate asking her professor about the foreign exchange programs available for students to immerse in, to learn and understand the diverse foreign cultures in our world. In the third situation, they encountered a member of the public asking a volunteer about how Singaporeans can benefit the people of other nations through social entrepreneurship. In the fourth situation, they encountered two polytechnic students discussing about how Singapore has been affected by global environmental issues and how we can play a role in solving these as well. In the final situation, they encountered two BPians discussing about Singapore’s Foreign Policy in helping other nations in disaster relief and peace negotiations.

To reinforce and contextualize the message of IFD, a CCE lesson on IFD was conducted where students reflect upon the contributions of our foreign workers and how we can better show appreciation to them for what their plight and sacrifices.  

  

The Parents Support Group also very kindly out set up three booths in the canteen during recess to display information about the profile and culture of three Northeastern nations - Japan, Korea and China. What made these booths such a big draw for students was the experiential approach taken to allow them to sample traditional snacks and try out cultural activities such as Chinese calligraphy and Korean game, Ddakji. 

  

All in all, the commemoration events and activities were well-received by Bpians, as seen by their engagement during the role-play presentation, their participation during the CCE lesson and the turnout at the three booths during both recesses.
