The Chinese Department celebrated the Mid-Autumn Festival with a mini concert. As the festival symbolises reunion of family and friends, the concert also served as a Homecoming event and we saw alumni of all ages turning up for the event. The palpable festive spirit was felt by all who attended the event on this enchanted evening.
