On 4 February 2019, BPGHS ushered in the Year of the Boar 2019 with a concert aptly named “亥”起来！  

  

The concert started with our Chinese Orchestra playing “By the River” and “Gongxi Gongxi”. Thereafter, a series of performances comprising dances and skits followed, showcasing our BPians’ multifaceted talents, confidence and grace. Each student also received a red packet, containing candies and chocolates, from his or her Form Teachers, as a symbol to bestow upon each and every one of them happiness and blessings.  
  

As Chinese New Year is a period of festivity enjoyed by most Singaporeans, BPians also did their part to spread the spirit of festivity to the residents in the neighbourhood by presenting mandarin oranges to them at their residence. Operation Orange, as the activity is called, aims to give students the chance to spread the joy of Chinese New Year to the people around them and also to extend a gesture of goodwill to the residents who live near the school.
