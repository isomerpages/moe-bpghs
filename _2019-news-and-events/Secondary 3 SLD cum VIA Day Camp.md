In line with BPGHS Students’ Leadership Development Framework to develop BPians as aspiring leaders with the heart to serve, a two-day camp was organised for the Secondary three students to develop the 21st century competencies, hone their leadership qualitlies as well as appeal to their sense of empathy to serve the community.  
  

Through a series of structured activities, students were taught to expand their reach as student leaders, create a positive impact on their school or community and be a change maker. Students were also required to apply the various skills and knowledge acquired to organise meaningful activities for various communities in need.
