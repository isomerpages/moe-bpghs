For the first time, the school celebrated National Day in conjunction with BP Day by infusing National Education elements into BP Day. The day started out with the National Day Observance Ceremony and Parade in school. National pride and excitement was in the air as the school witnessed the proceedings of the ceremony, where our Principal delivered the National Day Message for schools. The Uniformed Groups also recited Our Recollections before commencing with the march-past.

After the ceremony, BPians traveled to the venues that they have selected to commence with BP Day. BPians not only got to foster closer ties with their classmates and teachers, but also got to know more about Singapore heritage to better appreciate what we have today. Here are some of learning experiences shared by students on the day:

_During our Naval Base Museum visit, I got to view the guns and early warships that were used to defend Singapore during World War II. I also learnt about the various operations conducted by the Republic of Singapore Navy, such as_ Operation Flying Eagle, _where the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) provided Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief to the victims of the Boxing Day Tsunami that hit Aceh, Indonesia in 2004. This visit has inspired me to one day join the SAF with a heart to serve._ 

_After going through the activities, I feel that we have become more bonded as there were questions that required us to solve as a class. We got to learn how to work together and how to accept one another’s opinions._

_We went to Marina Barrage and it was there that I learnt how complex Marina Barrage was. It not only acts as a reservoir, but also doubles as a flood-control measure. The barrage also provides a venue for lifestyle activities such as kite-flying. I am now better able to appreciate the architecture in Singapore as much thought goes into the construction of our infrastructure._

_After the bonding activities, I felt closer to my classmates as I got to work with people I was not close to. As a result, I got to discover more about my classmates. I believe this was the same for other people as well. I feel happy knowing that everyone has forged stronger bonds within the class._ 

  

Miguel, Class 203

  

_I have learnt that the Former Ford factory is the place where the British surrendered to the Japanese Army on 15 Feb 1942. During the Japanese Occupation, many Singaporeans were mistreated and even killed. I learnt that we need to protect ourselves and no one owes us a living._
