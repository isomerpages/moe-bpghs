The Sec 2 Career Guidance & Exploration programme was conducted over 6 sessions by a group of professionals from the voluntary group called 'The Astronaut Collective' (TAC). 

TAC comprises a group of professionals in various fields who have come together to design and implement the Career Guidance Programme to benefit the Secondary 2 students. They shared their own work experiences in terms of the demands as well as expectations and mentored the students who were interested to learn more about their career exploration journeys. The students also embarked on learning journeys to various venues where they gained valuable opportunities to learn more about their mentors’ professions.

Through the rich and interactive sessions, students gained a better understanding of the values and skills needed to be successful in the 21st century workplace. Through the reflective discussions with their mentors and peers, the students explored the various factors influencing their educational and career decision making process, enabling them to think deeper about those factors and what motivate(s) them, so that they could be better informed about making the right decisions for themselves.  

The programme was well received and the students thoroughly enjoyed the interactive sessions and benefited from the advice and wisdom offered by their mentors. Additionally, some shared that the programme gave them a rare insight into the working world and felt that it was an enriching experience.

Testimonies from students:

_“I greatly appreciated that the mentor was very open about what we could discuss. We were able to discuss some sensitive topics but in a constructive and educational manner."_

_“This programme has taught me that there are many different ways to conquer one’s difficulties regardless of how challenging they may be.”_ 

_“I was able_ _to seek advice on my career path instead of having to figure everything out by myself. I could also learn more about my mentors' experiences with their jobs and how we could avoid making the mistakes they have made.”_

_“I enjoyed the field trip where I got to visit the Innovation Symposium with my mentor and my fellow groupmates where we were introduced to new experiences that would otherwise remain foreign to us.”_
