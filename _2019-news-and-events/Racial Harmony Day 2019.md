Racial Harmony Day (RHD) is one of the four National Education (NE) events commemorated in all Singapore schools in July. On this day, students will reflect on and celebrate Singapore as a harmonious society built on a rich diversity of cultures. RHD serves as a reminder that promoting social cohesion and racial harmony requires collaborative efforts from our educators, students and stakeholders.

This yearâ€™s theme is titled The Singapore Connection. As we commemorate our Bicentennial Experience, we reflect on our shared experiences and values that have connected us as Singaporeans and consider how we can empower our younger generation to remain open and inclusive as our society becomes increasingly complex. Based on the theme, the Secondary 2 NE ambassadors presented on RHD as a mark of the anniversary of the 1964 racial riots. They also put up a short skit so that students can understand and respect the customs and traditions of the different races and religions to coexist peacefully.  
  
The Parents Support Group also very kindly out set up booths in the canteen during recess to display information about the different ethnic groups. What made these booths such a big draw for students was the experiential approach taken to allow them to sample traditional snacks and try out cultural activities such as henna and chapteh.  
  
All in all, the commemoration events and activities were well-received by Bpians, as seen by their engagement during the presentation and the turnout at the booths during both recesses.
