<strong><u>Sec 2 Adventure Camp @ Labrador MOE Adventure Centre â€“ 27 to 30 May 2019</u></strong>

  

The Secondary Two camp has always been one of the highlights of the BPIAN experience and this year was no exception. For the first time, students experienced communal living in the rugged outdoors. Despite the extended duration of four days and three nights, core values of resilience, courage and strong camaraderie were on full display by the students as they went through a variety of activities which included the High Rope Challenge, Dragon boating and Caving. This camp will be fondly remembered not just for how BPIANS stepped out of their comfort zone and overcame their fears but even more so for the new friendships and memories forged.
