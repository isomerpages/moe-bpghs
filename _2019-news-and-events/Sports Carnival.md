The annual Sports Carnival took place on 15 March this year. The highly anticipated event saw BPians display their skills, teamwork, sportsmanship and yes, the BPian spirit. It was an electrifying end to the school term as BPians cheered for one another tirelessly and appreciated the efforts put in by their teammates. Three cheers for BPians!
