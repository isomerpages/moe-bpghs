In mid November, our school had an Open House that was open to the public. The turnout was great, judging by the over 900 goodie bags that were distributed to the public, as well as the many former students who returned to support the school event. It was a vibrant and lively atmosphere, to say the least. Many visitors were bowled over by the awesome performances by our band, dance, chinese orchestra, choir, the national cadet corps and malay dance. Parents and possible prospective students had an engaging time with the hands-on activities such as the Food & Nutrition experience in the kitchen, the Science experience in the laboratories and the Design & Technology experience in the workshop. Visitors also gleaned information about the school through the sharing by the Principal, the academic programme booths, as well as the co-curricular activity booths. Come join us at our next Open House and be a part of the BPian Experience!
