Teachers and students gathered at the Victoria Theatre in the afternoon on 25 April 2019 to watch a presentation put up by the performing arts CCAs. The presentation was named SPARKLE, an apt name as each and every performer that day began in their various performing arts groups as diamonds in the rough. Over the months, they rehearsed tirelessly to polish their skills. They displayed grit when they encountered setbacks and they emerged more confident under the constant pressures of rehearsal and performance, and finally they were ready to sparkle on stage. It was our privilege to witness the culmination of all the efforts the respective groups put into their Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation showcase.
