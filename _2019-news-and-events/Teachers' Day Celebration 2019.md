We celebrated this year’s Teachers’ Day Concert with the theme THEN AND NOW, delving into the evolution of teaching from its early days in the 60s till today. Teachers and students alike were treated to a time of reminiscing the good ol’ days, celebrating the teachers’ work through the generations as they relived their memories of teaching and learning in their earlier years.  
  
Teachers came in their best retro-educator gears, decked out in memories of what their own teachers wore back in the 60s, to what they themselves used to wear in the 80s, and other variations of memories captured in fashion.  

Through electrifying dance performances that catapulted us back to the retro era, to trivia games that informed us of what school life was like back then, to blast-from-the-past sing-alongs and other heartfelt acts, we celebrate and appreciate the love poured out by our teachers, which transcends all of time.
