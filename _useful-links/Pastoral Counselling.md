### Pastoral Counselling

<center><em>Sometimes it’s difficult to say what is on your mind<br>Sometimes grief can build up to take control of your life<br>Sometimes you don’t know which direction to take or where to begin<br>Sometimes you just need a listening ear…</em></center>

  

We all experience personal challenges or issues in our lives. Most of the time, we can work things out by talking to our family or friends, or trying to deal with things ourselves. There are, however, times when issues may be too much for us to handle on our own and seeking support from a counsellor can be helpful in such situations.

  

In BPGHS, counselling services are offered to students who require guidance to explore their difficulties. Through counselling, students are provided with a positive outlet to address their underlying issues and to facilitate their learning in school.

  

Some areas students may require support include:

  

*   Academic stress management
*   Addiction
*   Anger management
*   Anxiety and mood issues
*   Bullying
*   Body image concerns
*   Grief and Loss
*   Relationship issues
*   Self-identity
*   Self-esteem
*   Self-harm
*   Transition to secondary school
