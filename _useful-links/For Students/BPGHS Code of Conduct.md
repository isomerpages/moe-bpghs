<h1>Student Management</h1>
<p>In Bukit Panjang Government High School, we believe that every child can
engage in behaviours that enable him/her to learn and develop.</p>
<p>Students learn best in a supportive environment. We endeavour to continue
to build a safe, respectful and caring community that promotes and supports
positive student behaviours and discipline, so that teaching and learning
opportunities are maximised and students are motivated to put forth their
best in their pursuits.</p>
<p>With this philosophy, we are committed to support students with timely
corrective guidance to address their misbehaviour, which may deter them
from learning effectively.</p>

</ul>
<h1>Expected Student Behaviour inside/outside of school</h1>
<p>Students are to exercise self-discipline and exemplify school values,
whether in/outside the school. They must uphold the good name of the school
by conducting themselves in a disciplined and responsible manner. Their
every action has a bearing on the image of the school and the reputation
of the entire student body.</p>
<p>Students must learn to be responsible for their actions and expect certain
consequences if they choose to break the school rules and regulations.
Any student who witnesses anyone doing things detrimental to the school,
himself/herself or other school mates must bring it to the attention of
any staff of the school immediately.</p>
<h1>Representation of School</h1>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students may not use the name, image, logo or uniform of Bukit Panjang
Government High School, nor may students use representations of staff or
students in any medium, including, but not limited to electronic, paper,
video and sound, in a manner not in keeping with the mission and values
of the school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Posting pictures, videos, emails or other communication of staff without
the express permission of the staff is also prohibited. These prohibitions
specifically include, but are not limited to pictures, emails, personal
web pages, social networking sites and blogs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students who display information, pictures or language contrary to school
policy and the mission and values of the school on such a site, or in any

representation of the school’s name, image, uniform and logos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students may be barred from representing the school in competitions or
other school activities if their conduct/behaviour is deemed to have infringed
school rules and regulations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Conduct Grade</h1>
<p>A conduct grade reflects a student’s general conduct or behaviour throughout
the semester. In BPGHS, all students are expected to exemplify the school
values in their attitude and behaviour. They are also expected to demonstrate
self-discipline and abide by all the school rules and regulations.</p>
<p>Assessment of conduct grades is based on teachers’ assessment of the students’
demonstration of the school values (respect, resilience, integrity, responsibility
and care for others). A student’s conduct grade will be assigned towards
the end of each semester by the Form Teacher(s), a selected subject teacher
and the teacher in charge of the student’s CCA.</p>
<p>For students who have committed any minor or major offences, the HOD/Student
Management and Student Development Team will adjust the conduct grade for
the students in accordance with the school’s disciplinary measures.</p>
<p>Only students with conduct grade ‘Good’ and above will be eligible for
any government or school awards, e.g. Edusave/Eagles/Colours/Edusave Character
Award.</p>
<p>The following guide will be used by teachers in assigning the conduct
grade to each student:</p>

<h1>Discipline Management for Major and Minor Offences</h1>
<p>As the school strives to provide a safe, respectful and caring community
that promotes and supports positive student behaviour and discipline, students
are also expected to learn and take responsibility for their actions or
misbehaviours, and be expected to receive certain consequences if they
choose to break the school rules and regulations.</p>
<p>The school reserves the right to revise, formulate and add new rules as
it deems necessary. The HOD/Student Management, together with the Student
Development Team, are authorised to deliberate and decide on the form of
consequences to be meted out for any misbehaviour or misdeed of a student.</p>
<p>At stipulated junctures for each offence, teachers will update HOD/Student
Management and/or the Student Development Team for follow-up actions.</p>
<p>All offences (major and minor cases) will be recorded in the School Cockpit
Offence Module (SOM). Only students with Good Conduct Grade and above will
be eligible for MOE Edusave / EAGLES/ Colours/ Edusave Character Award
and other school awards.</p>
