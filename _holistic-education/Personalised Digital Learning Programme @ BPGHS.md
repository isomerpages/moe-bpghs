### Personalised Learning Device (PLD) Initiative @ BPGHS

MOE’s National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) was launched in March 2020 for our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning. The NDLP aims to strengthen digital literacy for all learners and to ensure that students are well-equipped with the digital competencies to thrive in an increasingly technology-saturated future. 

Under the NDLP, every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD). 


  

  
### Intended Outcomes

The use of the personal learning device for teaching and learning aims to:

<table style="border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0" class="tg"><thead><tr><th style="background-color:#FFF;border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:bold;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;text-align:center;vertical-align:top;word-break:normal">Enhance Teaching<br>and Learning</th><th style="background-color:#FFF;border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:bold;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;text-align:center;vertical-align:top;word-break:normal">Support Self-Directed and<br>Collaborative Learning</th><th style="background-color:#FFF;border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:bold;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;text-align:center;vertical-align:top;word-break:normal">Support the Development of<br>Digital Literacies </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="background-color:#FFF;border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;text-align:center;vertical-align:top;word-break:normal"><img src="/images/IO%201.jpg" style="width:100%"></td><td style="background-color:#FFF;border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;text-align:center;vertical-align:top;word-break:normal"><img src="/images/IO%202.jpg" style="width:100%"></td><td style="background-color:#FFF;border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;text-align:center;vertical-align:top;word-break:normal"><img src="/images/IO%203.jpg" style="width:100%"></td></tr></tbody></table>
		 
		 

By equipping students with their own PLD, schools can:

*   **Enhance Teaching and Learning:**&nbsp;PLDs harness technology for greater effectiveness in teaching and learning, enabled by teachers’ use of e-Pedagogy to provide active learning experiences for students.
*   **Support Self-Directed and Collaborative Learning:**&nbsp;PLDs enable students to learn online according to their needs and interests, and to collaborate with each other, anytime and anywhere.
*   **Support the Development of Digital Literacies:**&nbsp;PLDs provide an immersive environment for students to develop the dispositions, knowledge and skills to thrive in the digital environment.
