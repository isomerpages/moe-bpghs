<h3>Aesthetics</h3>
<p>Under the Aesthetics arm, we have the Art and Music Units. The design
of the Art and Music lessons are modular in nature and based on the 3E
(Excite, Engage &amp; Excel) Framework.</p>
<p>The Music Unit develops students’ awareness and appreciation of local
and global music and cultivates their ability to express and communicate
creatively through music. In Secondary One and Two, students are exposed
to music practices such as singing, playing the keyboard and percussion
instruments, as well as music history and theory.</p>
<p>In the Art unit, there are the Art Elective Programme (AEP) and the General
Art Programme (GAP). The AEP is offered in seven selected schools in Singapore
and offers an enriched and varied art curriculum to artistically inclined
students. It is a four-year programme and students read Higher Art as one
of the ‘O’ level subjects at Secondary Four. The GAP is offered to all
Secondary One and Two students. Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical)
students will continue to offer upper secondary art based on their skills
and choices during streaming. In BPGHS, we align our learning outcomes
of the aesthetics department to that of art practitioners, advocates and
scholars (for AEP students).</p>
<p>To introduce our students to more art forms, a dance and music programme
named ‘GROOVE IT’ is organised for all Secondary Three students. Students
have a choice to select the dance and music modules (eg. Bollywood, Hip
Hop, Pop Vocal etc) they want to learn from the professionals engaged.
Thereafter, they will put up a performance to showcase the new skills acquired
to the rest of the Secondary Three cohort.</p>
<p>In the AEP, besides classroom teaching, we also have various enrichment
programmes planned for our students. Secondary One to Three students will
attend enrichment workshops (eg. printmaking, painting, sculptures, digital
media) during the June and November holidays taught by external art practitioners.
Besides these workshops, there is also a combined schools workshop every
year for them, which will culminate in an AEP exhibition (combined schools)
once every two years.</p>
<p>To expose our students to overseas art and culture, in 2018, selected
Secondary Two and Three students went on an Art Immersion Trip to Japan,
Tokyo.</p>
