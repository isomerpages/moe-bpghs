The Humanities department comprises the disciplines of History, Geography and Social Studies.  
  
**Teaching approaches**  
  
In teaching the humanities, a concept-centric approach is used. Students attain conceptual understanding and demonstrate their understanding by drawing on content knowledge to illustrate the concepts.  
  
E-pedagogy is applied through the use of Student Learning Space (SLS) and flipped classroom to allow students to attain information before curriculum time. This information serves as prior knowledge that students utilize for the various activities and discussions during curriculum time. Teachers also utilize other platforms to allow students equal opportunities to participate in class as well as receive feedback more instantly.  
  
**Authentic learning** 

Students are actively involved in Historical Investigation (HI), Geographical Investigation (GI) as well as Issues Investigation (II) as part of their Humanities curriculum.  
  
<u>Geographical Investigation Activities</u>

*   Investigate water quality in the canal nearby and water features in the school
*   Determine the effectiveness of Singapore’s public transport system by studying data
*   Measure weather elements such as rainfall, humidity and temperature in school
*   Measure beach profile and wave elements at East Coast Park
*   Determine reasons for visits to Sentosa by studying data

  
Using the Inquiry process to study primary and secondary sources, students draw conclusions on the following:  
  
<u>Historical Investigation (Some examples include:)</u>

*   How far did the contributions of the early migrants meet the educational and healthcare needs of the local community in pre-war Singapore?
*   Was merger good for Singapore
*   Did the lives of the Germans improve during Hitler’s rule?

  

<u>Issues Investigation (Some examples include:)</u>

*   How were the needs of the people living in Singapore met during the COVID-19 outbreak?
