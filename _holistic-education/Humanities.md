### Humanities

The Humanities department comprises the disciplines of History, Geography and Social Studies.  
  
**Teaching approaches**  
  
In teaching the humanities, a concept-centric approach is used. Students attain conceptual understanding and demonstrate their understanding by drawing on content knowledge to illustrate the concepts.  
  
E-pedagogy is applied through the use of Student Learning Space (SLS) and flipped classroom to allow students to attain information before curriculum time. This information serves as prior knowledge that students utilize for the various activities and discussions during curriculum time. Teachers also utilize other platforms to allow students equal opportunities to participate in class as well as receive feedback more instantly.  
  
**Authentic learning** 

Students are actively involved in Historical Investigation (HI), Geographical Investigation (GI) Issues Investigation (II) as well as Performance Task (PT) as part of their Humanities curriculum.  
  
Using the Inquiry process to study primary and secondary sources, students draw conclusions and present their findings in using different mediums. These activities provide the opportunities for the students to collaborate as teams. They also allow the students to showcase their critical thinking skills and creativity.  
  

The school also organizes learning journeys and humanities interclass competitions to enthuse the students in their learning.

**Stretching studentsâ€™ potentials**

Students who show keen interest or potentials are selected to represent the school at interschool events such as conferences, model United Nations and competitions. Such platforms allowed the students to deepen their knowledge of the humanities, it also allowed the students to interact with student from other schools, widening their social networks.
