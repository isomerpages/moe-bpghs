### Mother Tongue

The Mother Tongue Department seeks to offer a range of student learning experiences for purposeful and meaningful student engagement, with the aim to spark interest in the learning of their mother tongue languages, and support student learning for deep subject mastery.

#### Chinese Language Unit

 **Chinese Language and Higher Chinese   热爱母语 弘扬文化**
 
 **Use of Pedagogical Approaches**
 
Through the use of suitable innovative pedagogical approaches such as the Inquiry-based Learning and Questions-based Learning tasks, the Chinese Unit aims to promote authentic learning and ignite the joy of learning among the students as they grasp the essential knowledge and skills in the mother tongue languages. Apart from the rigorous performance tasks, we also provide timely and constructive feedback to boost our students’ learning, and at the same time, leverage different ICT tools, such as Student Learning Space (SLS), to enhance their oral communication skills.

**Stretching of the students’ abilities beyond the classroom**

  
The Unit's pedagogical approaches are supplemented with numerous platforms to stretch students beyond meeting syllabus requirements. As an illustration,students  are strongly encouraged to sit for the Chinese Proficiency Test (汉语水平考试) which is an international standardized test for Chinese language proficiency. Over the years,HSK scores have  become a requirement for international students to prove their Chinese language proficiencies if they would like to apply for scholarships in the top universities of China. Moreover, students also have the opportunities of participating in competitions such as  “Script It Right” Chinese Radio Drama Script Writing Competition, the National Secondary Schools Translation Competition, “Global Village” Children & Youths Bilingual Speech Competition, the National Chinese Poem-Writing Competition and the National Chinese Challenge.

**Mother Tongue Fortnight Programme**

Across all levels, students participate in the Mother Tongue Fortnight Programme which provides them with the opportunity of learning decorative art such as Chinese calligraphy and painting, Chinese tea appreciation, and martial arts like Wushu and Silat. These programmes and workshops would help to deepen the students’ learning of Chinese language and culture.



**Cultural Exposure & theatrical experience (武中戏曲团)**

Apart from the instructional programmes, the Unit aims to promote and strengthen our students’ sense of cultural heritage and identity through a variety of programmes such as the Chinese New Year Celebration, Mid-Autumn Festival Celebration and the Cultural Performance.

The Cultural Performance is an event which allows students to be exposed to traditional Chinese Opera and provide them with an exciting theatrical experience. The Chinese Opera Ensemble has presented a myriad of productions over the last 20 years.These include scenes from Woman of Valour (穆桂英), Romance of the Cyprinus Carpio (碧波仙子),The Road to Justice（状告驸马) and the Legend of the White Snake (白蛇传).The opera team has also been invited to perform locally as well as abroad. Everyone of its production had earned praises from audiences worldwide and had received favorable reviews from the press.

**Overseas Immersion Programmes**

Other than learning about the different cultures in school,the Unit organizes overseas immersion programmes to broaden our students’ global awareness. To date, overseas immersion trips to China (Chengdu, Xi’an, Beijing, Shanghai, Xiamen), and Taiwan have been organized。
  
#### Malay Language Unit

  

To ignite their joy of learning, students are given the opportunity to learn and use the Malay language in various contexts and platforms. Students take part in competitions organised at the national level, such as Bisikan Pena organised by NUS Malay Language Society, Blackout Poetry, and Pena Emasku Creative Writing.
