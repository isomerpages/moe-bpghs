Dear Parents / Guardians

**From 8 April 2020, all MOE schools will shift to full Home-Based Learning (HBL) till 4 May 2020.** We have briefed all students on what to expect when full HBL starts for BPGHS, including the new full HBL timetable and some informative tips on effective HBL practices your child should observe. Our school has consolidated all the information on a **BP HBL 2020** website so that your child can stay updated during the entire full HBL period for their learning. You may access the link here [http](http://go.gov.sg/bphbl)[://](http://go.gov.sg/bphbl)[go.gov.sg/bphbl](http://go.gov.sg/bphbl).

Please refer to the Full HBL timetable below.
