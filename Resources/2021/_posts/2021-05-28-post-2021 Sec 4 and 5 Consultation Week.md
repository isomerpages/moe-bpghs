Dear BPians and Parents,  
  
For the safety and health of all students and staff of the school, the Secondary 4 and 5 Consultation Week will take place **online** for identified students.  
  

These are the objectives of Consultation Week:

1) To provide academic support to students who require help based on their MYE results;

2) To help underperforming students kick-start their revision so they spend the June holidays productively.

  
Please refer to the PDF file below for the Consultation Week schedule.
