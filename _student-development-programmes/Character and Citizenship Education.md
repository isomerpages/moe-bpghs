<h3>Character and Citizenship Education</h3>
<p><em>To access a list of CCE programmes, click on the menu tab at the top of this page (mobile version).</em>
</p>
<p>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is at the heart of education
in Singapore.&nbsp; Through CCE, students learn values, social-emotional
competencies, and develop character and citizenship dispositions that enable
them to grow holistically and learn for life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goals of CCE in BPGHS is to develop every BPian into an inspiring
leader who embodies the school values (respect, responsibility, resilience,
integrity and care for others) and a heart to serve.&nbsp; By developing
inspiring leaders, we develop in them.</p>
<p><strong>1. The heart to serve for a good cause</strong>

education and career pathways and to take on the challenge to serve their
personal mission.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Learning experiences for every BPian</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>1. Student development experiences&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Every school experience is a CCE learning experience.&nbsp; To ensure
learning, school experiences are meaningfully arranged so that students
would spend time preparing for the school experiences, implement what they
planned and reflect on their learning.&nbsp; This approach is pervasive
throughout the 4-5 years in BPGHS in programmes such as cohort camps, national
education commemorative days, values in action (VIA) activities, mental
wellbeing programmes, cyberwellness programme and student leadership learning.</p>
<p><strong>2. Student leadership development&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>The school adopt the five practices of the leadership challenge model
to develop in BPians the skills required of an inspiring leader.&nbsp;
Students are taught the five practices in the CCE lessons and are required
to demonstrate these practices in the projects given to them such as the
VIA programmes, the National Day project, the CCA projects and the Mental
Wellbeing Day project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Values in Action (VIA)&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>The values in action (VIA) programmes provides students the excellent
opportunity to apply the knowledge they learn in the CCE lessons into action.&nbsp;
This includes the application of the school values and the five leadership
practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the design thinking approach, the level VIA programmes provide students
the opportunity to plan for activities to benefit the community through
understanding the community, defining the project, ideating the plan, prototyping,
implementing and reflection.&nbsp; This process allows students to learn
and practise 21st century skills such as adaptive thinking, inventive thinking
and communication skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Activities planned for the levels include efforts towards the environment,
providing joy to the elderly, providing learning to pre-schoolers and organising
game booths for fellow BPians.&nbsp; For the Sec 4 students, the students
get a choice on the area of community needs they wish to work on.&nbsp;
BPians get to source for the VIA partners to find out the community needs
and plan the project to suit their needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides the level VIA, BPians are encouraged to organise their own student-initiated
projects and they are mentored by the Student Leadership teacher mentors
to implement such projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. National Education (NE)&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>The aims of NE are to provide BPians with the knowledge, skills and values
to understand Singapore’s history, realities and challenges, appreciate
our journey to nationhood and cultivate the instincts for the nation’s
survival.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the CCE lessons, BPians gets to discuss contemporary issues.&nbsp;
Through these discussions, BPians gets to develop critical thinking skills
and perspective taking skills while understanding, the local, the regional
and the global issues.&nbsp; Other than the CCE lessons, NE learning journeys
are planned for BPians.</p>
<p>In every class, there are two NE ambassadors.&nbsp; These NE ambassadors
meet to plan class and school activities in the four NE commemorative days
(namely Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony
Day and National Day).&nbsp; Through their planning, they develop their
student leadership skills and 21CC skills such as communication and inventive
thinking skills.</p>
<p><strong>5. Education and Career Guidance (ECG)</strong>
</p>
<p>BPians today face a future that will be very difficult from the parents
and the teachers.&nbsp; Education and Career Guidance is about equipping
BPians with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to make informed
decisions for successful transition from school to post-secondary secondary
and to manage their career pathways and life learning throughout their
lives.&nbsp; Through ECG, BPians explore their strengths and abilities,
examine their life’s purpose and develop the skills to stay relevant for
the future.</p>
<p>BPGHS partners with more than 30 partners from the industries and all
the post-secondary education institution to bring different programmes
to BPians.&nbsp; Particularly for the upper secondary, BPians get to talk
to partners from the industries and have at least two learning journeys
to the industries.</p>
<p><strong>6. Cyber Wellness (CW)</strong>
</p>
<p>Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are becoming increasingly
pervasive in our world. While creating instant connectivity and access
to vast repositories of information, knowledge, and opinions, the open
nature of the Internet can expose BPians to undesirable content and influences.
Cyber wellness in CCE is important as it focuses on the well-being of BPians
as they navigate cyberspace, equipping them with the knowledge and skills
to harness the power of ICT for positive purposes, maintain a positive
presence in cyberspace, and be safe and responsible users of ICT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The school believes in providing opportunities for BPians to teach BPians.&nbsp;
In each lower secondary class, the peer support leaders get to create their
own lesson package on cyber wellness and teach fellow classmates during
the CCE lessons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7. Mental Wellbeing (MWB)</strong>
</p>
<p>Mental health is about having a balance in various aspects of life, and
learning values and social-emotional competencies to cope with life’s situations,
relate to others and contribute to the community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In BPGHS, mental well-being CCE lessons helps students to strengthen their
resilience and well-being; differentiate between stress, distress (overwhelming
stress), and illness; enhance help-seeking efficacy; as well as destigmatise
mental illness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The school has a progressive programme that strengthens their social-emotional
competencies through teaching them the relevant Habits of Mind in their
lower secondary years.&nbsp; From secondary 2 to 3, they also goes through
two different workshops to help them understand the different issues in
mental health and how to overcome each issues.&nbsp; By secondary three,
BPians becomes our mental wellbeing ambassadors as they worked towards
equipping the other BPians with the knowledge of mental wellbeing through
games.</p>
