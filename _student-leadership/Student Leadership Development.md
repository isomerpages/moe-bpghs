<p><strong>Philosophy of SLD in BPGHS</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Every BPian should be developed as a leader</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leadership is not just positional, but also dispositional.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every student possesses his/her unique blend of abilities, inclinations
and talents. Thus, he/she is able to make a positive difference within
his/her sphere of influence, and thereby be a leader.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leadership is values-driven.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Student Leadership Development needs to be grounded in sound values to
enable student leaders to lead others to achieve goals in an ethical way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leadership should be about effecting positive change on behalf of others
and society.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BPGHS aims to develop every BPian to be inspiring leaders, anchored in
values and with a heart to serve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Student Leadership Development is a purposeful and collaborative process
that fosters social change for the common good.</p>

<p><strong>1. Guiding Principles</strong>

<p><strong>2. Service</strong>
<br>The Student Leadership Development Framework calls for leadership directed
towards a greater purpose than self, which is ‘service’ beyond the personal
needs to include the needs of the school and the community, as depicted
at the core of the framework. The framework is grounded in the belief that
every leadership effort should culminate in a positive impact on others,
which can consist of their peers, school or the wider community.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>3. Self Leadership. Team Leadership. Thought Leadership</strong>
<br>The framework describes an interaction between three dimensions of Student
Leadership Development – Self-Leadership, Team Leadership and Thought Leadership.
The essence of each dimension of leadership is as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<table style="minWidth: 50px">

<col>
<col>
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Self-Leadership:</p>
</th>
<th rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Awareness of one’s own strengths and talents and rootedness in sound values
is the basis of strong leadership for service.</p>
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Team Leadership:</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Students need to learn how to work collaboratively with others to effect
change for the betterment of others.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Thought Leadership:</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>The ability to envision a future and inspire and mobilise others to serve
together.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The framework takes reference from the four elements of critical consciousness
development (Cipolle, 2010, p.7), which are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>developing a deeper awareness of self</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing a deeper awareness and broader perspective of others</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing a deeper awareness and broader perspective of social issues</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>seeing one’s potential to make change</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It also emphasises the experiential learning process of leadership among
students, as reflected by the dual-headed arrows around the three dimensions
of leadership. It encourages the continual process of service and reflection,
deepening the growth of oneself in any of the dimensions in which one is
in.</p>
<p><strong>4. Personal. School. Community</strong>
<br>The outer-most ring represents the three key groups of stakeholders that
are involved in the Student Leadership Programmes — Personal, School and
the Community.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The school leverages community resources and expertise of external partners
to provide the necessary training and opportunities to our students. As
leadership development is a continual and directed journey, teacher guidance
and mentorship is critical in providing the impetus for successful development
of leadership values, skills and knowledge in students.</p>
<p><strong>Key Platform: Student-initiated Activities (SiA)</strong>
<br>Student-initiated Activities (SiA) is one of the key platforms for students
to develop their leadership skills. Students work in groups or as a class
to propose projects in support of a good cause. SiA provides opportunities
for students to build team spirit and develop the entrepreneurial dare,
as well as a greater appetite for risk-taking and experimentation.</p>
<p>BPians who are keen to make a positive impact on their lives of others
in the school or community may launch a SiA project by gathering interested
peers and obtaining the endorsement from the school SLD team for implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the SiA projects carried out:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Partnering Organisation: Precious Active Ageing Centre @ Sunshine Garden</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Picture1.png">
</div>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> The activity aimed to foster intergenerational
bonds by creating opportunities for students to engage with seniors meaningfully.
Through shared activities, students hoped to promote joy, connection, and
mutual understanding, while also encouraging seniors to stay active and
socially engaged.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights of the Activity: </strong>Students organised a lively
afternoon filled with activities that encouraged interaction, creativity,
and fun:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Karaoke sessions: students and seniors sang familiar tunes together, bridging
generations through music.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Polaroid photo-taking: capturing special moments as keepsakes for the
seniors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scrapbooking: students and seniors worked side by side to design personalised
pages, turning memories into colourful creations.</p>
<hr>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Partnering Organisation: Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA)</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> The activity aimed to raise awareness about
animal welfare and the importance of adopting pets instead of buying them.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights of the Activity:</strong> Students set up a vibrant
booth featuring a range of animal-themed merchandise such as keychains,
coasters, notebooks, and bookmarks.
<br>Over three days, students engaged their peers in meaningful conversations
about animal welfare, while raising funds to support SPCA’s ongoing efforts.</p>
