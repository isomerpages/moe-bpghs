<h1><strong>Student Council</strong></h1>
<p>The Student Council of Bukit Panjang Government High School plays a vital
role in nurturing student leadership and fostering a vibrant school community.
Guided by the school vision of developing <em>l</em>eaders of good who think,
care and serve, the council provides opportunities for students to grow
as responsible leaders who are committed to making a positive difference.</p>
<p>The council serves as an important bridge between the student body and
the school. Through platforms such as BPVoices (<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/bpvoices/home" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>https://sites.google.com/view/bpvoices/home</u></a>),
councillors represent student perspectives, gather feedback, and work closely
with the school management team to enhance the overall student experience.</p>
<p>To fulfil these responsibilities, councillors undergo structured trainings
during Student Leadership Camp and on-job trainings in leadership, communication,
and project management. These developmental programmes equip them with
the confidence, skills, and mindset to lead with purpose and serve the
school community with dedication.</p>
