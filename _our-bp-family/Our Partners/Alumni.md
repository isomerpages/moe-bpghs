### Alumni

<strong><u>President's Scholar &amp; SAF Scholar 2016 (Natasha Ann Lum)</u></strong>

![](/images/Alumni%20-%20Natasha%20Ann%20Lum.jpeg)

  
We heartily congratulate our alumna, Natasha Ann Lum, for attaining the President’s Scholarship and SAF Scholarship this year. Natasha was an outstanding personality in her class. Her form teacher, Ms Trina Tay, recalls that Natasha was both a persuasive speaker and a good writer. Her eloquence had made her stand out as the youngest finalist out of more than 150 adult competitors in 'The Search for a Host for Rediffusion', a talent search for bilingual emcees. It made her a natural choice to emcee multiple school events.

Natasha was also an active member of the National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC). She was the Secondary 3 Squad Commander and had attained the rank of Staff Sergeant. For her leadership and service to the school and to NPCC, she was awarded the Eagles Award for Leadership and the prestigious Singapore Police Force badge.

We are proud of Natasha’s achievements and are confident that she will go on to serve the nation well. Congratulations, Natasha!

*I have many fond memories of my journey in BPGHS. I made many good friends, and most have stuck by me until now. We still meet every now and then. There is an inexplicable sense of belonging to the BPian community. Also, my teachers were passionate and caring. They kept encouraging me to strive for academic excellence even though, at certain points, I did not have half of the belief they had in me. I was really grateful for all their help, guidance and care. Moreover, they inspired me to pursue a career in teaching and they remain an inspiration to me. Thank you, BPGHS, for having given me such a wonderful schooling experience.*

*In BPGHS, I developed my self-confidence and learned the importance of friendship. Before joining the National Science Challenge, never could I have imagined presenting before a huge audience, including subject-matter experts, no less. Nonetheless, my team’s relentless encouragement gave me the courage necessary. Indeed, true friends should be cherished as they are genuine to you through thick and thin, and will grant you the strength to conquer even the most trying of moments.*
