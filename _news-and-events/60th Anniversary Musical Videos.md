# 60th Anniversary Musical Videos

As part of our school’s 60th Anniversary celebrations, we initially planned to stage an original musical entitled Homecoming, based on true-life events that revolved around our school. However, the musical had to be cancelled due to the COVID-19 situation. While we are unable to bring the musical to life on stage, we hope that this video has captured the spirit of our performance.
