On 19 December 2019, our Secondary Four Normal Academic and Normal Technical students returned to school for the release of the GCE N-Level results. They waited eagerly for their results while they perused the Joint Intake Exercise booklets for possible course options before the official release started at 2 pm. They listened patiently to the briefing by the Level Head on the application process to the various institutes and the sharing of the overall performance of the cohort by our Principal, Mr Chua. The Form Teachers then issued the results to the students individually, always ready with encouraging and supportive words.  There were many students who shed tears of joy over their stellar results. Many parents were also in attendance and they looked on proudly, sharing in their childâ€™s happiness that their hard work over the course of four years had paid off handsomely. Some students and parents sought the advice of the staff present with regards to the course options. Students were also able to consult the lecturers from the Institute of Technical Education who had set up a booth at the back of the hall to advise interested students. The school would like to congratulate all our students who have completed their GCE N-Levels!
