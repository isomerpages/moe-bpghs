<strong><u>Secondary One Orientation Programme 2019</u></strong>

  

To welcome our new students, the Student Council organised the annual Secondary One Orientation Programme. During the four-day programme, students got to know more about their schoolmates and classmates and also learned about their new environment. Students also got to work together and interact with one another to forge new friendships.

  

The Orientation Programme included the CCA Roadshow, which allowed the Secondary One students to know more about the various CCAs offered by the school. The Orientation Programme ended with a campfire where students showcased their talents and exuded the BPian Spirit.
