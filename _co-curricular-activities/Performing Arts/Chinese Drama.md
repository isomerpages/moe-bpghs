<p>The Chinese Drama Club was established in 2011 with the objective of using
theatre arts as a medium for student to increase their mastery and interest
in the Chinese Language.</p>
<p>The club consists of students who are passionate about acting and interested
to explore self-expression through the Chinese Language. With a heightened
awareness and skill set related to theatre performances, the students would
also develop a keener sense of aesthetic appreciation.</p>
