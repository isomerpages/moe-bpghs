<p>The Science Society Club is an umbrella CCA comprising three domains -
Astronomy, Robotics and Science Quiz. Every student is involved in two
or more domains to be exposed to a broad scope of knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>The Astronomy unit focuses on the study of celestial objects such as planets,
stars and nebulae, as well as various celestial phenomena. Students are
engaged through various content delivery methods such as hands-on activities,
games, quizzes and star-gazing. Through intensive training sessions, students
are equipped with in-depth astronomical knowledge and are able to explain
the various astronomical phenomena confidently. Plenty of opportunities
are also given to the students to teach, mentor and build up their presentation
skills.</p>
<p>The Robotics unit focuses on the construction of robots and programming
codes. Students relish the challenge of creating robots based on interesting
missions assigned to them. In the process of building robots, important
attributes such as team collaboration, perseverance, creativity and problem
solving skills are fostered.</p>
<p>The Science Quiz Unit focuses on the study of Science and Mathematics
at an advanced level, as well as to trigger curiosity and to ignite the
joy of learning Science and Mathematics. Through hands-on experiments,
group discussions, games and quizzes, the students are able to hone their
scientific knowledge and skills in an enjoyable way. The intensive training
sessions that they go through serve to build up their critical thinking
skills.</p>
<p>Through rigorous training, excellent teamwork and the determined mind
set to excel, all three units work very hard to achieve commendable results.
Some key achievements include Team First Runner Up for AstroChallenge Competition,
Best Booth Display for Crystal Growing Competition, Team Champion for ITE
Robotics Challenge (Obstacle Category) and numerous Individual Gold, Silver
and Bronze awards for C.B. Paul Science Quiz in Year 2018.</p>
<p>In addition, the students are also given plenty of opportunities for their
leadership and character development. Every year, they get to plan and
organise major events such as CCA roadshows, Values-in-Action (ViA) and
Science Team Camp to develop them into leaders with a heart to serve the
school and the community.</p>
