BP Communication Link promotes the mass enjoyment of quality sound and lighting effects across numerous school events through the provision of audio and lighting support. The club also ensures the smooth execution of daily morning assemblies in the courtyard and in the hall.

  

Members of the club get to learn how to operate a variety of Public Address (PA) systems across various school premises. Students also pick up valuable skills from their seniors and trainers on how to operate different types of equipment such as microphones, CD players and mixers. The club also hones the studentsâ€™ sense of responsibility, and initiative as they dedicate their services to the school.

  

In addition, members of the club gain exposure to operating equipment commonly used in other industries through structured learning journeys. This also allows them to explore related career paths in the PA industry.
