<p>Floorball was introduced as a Sports CCA in 2019.&nbsp; It is an indoor
team sport and it is a fast-paced sport that is played with lightweight
sticks and a plastic ball.&nbsp; Training is intense and players need to
be agile as they are required to change directions quickly. Floorball is
a game of strategy and it helps to build mental endurance.&nbsp; Players
have to learn to make decisions quickly due to the fast pace of the game.
Our boys enjoy the high intensity that the game provides and the camaraderie
formed during practices.</p>
<p>Floorball is a relatively new sport that has garnered much interest in
the local sports scene. There are currently about 10,000 floorball players
in Singapore with approximately 200 schools offering the sport as a CCA.&nbsp;
Bukit Panjang Secondary Floorball is proud to launch this sport as a formally
recognized CCA in 2019 and aims to bring out the very best in every member
of the team.</p>
