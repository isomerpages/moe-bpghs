<p>‘Discipline and Teamwork’ is the motto of the Bukit Panjang Government
High School (BPGHS) Basketball Team. The CCA provides a platform for players
to discover their strengths, weaknesses and leadership qualities by being
a part of this exclusive team. Every team member ardently encourages his
peers to train hard, train well, focus and to do his utmost for the team,
with or without the ball in possession.</p>
<p>Players train on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays during the school term
and with added intensity during school holidays and competition periods.
This ensures that the gentlemen are well-prepared for the West Zone Inter-School
Basketball Competition and Nationals once qualification is secured. The
team also participates in other competitions and friendly games throughout
the year against quality opponents from international schools.</p>
<p>The team will continue to strive for excellence and uphold the good name
of the school. The journey together is amplified by the team’s belief:&nbsp;<strong>“It doesn’t matter who scores the most or gets the most rebounds, as long as we do it together.”</strong>
