<p>The Bukit Panjang National Cadet Corps (BPNCC) unit is a&nbsp;uniformed
group that aims to nurture student cadets to have a Committed Heart, a
Resilient Mind and a Fit Body. The unit was awarded Distinction for the
2022 Unit Recognition Award after a demanding year of training and courses
attended by cadets. This is the pinnacle award an NCC unit can achieve
for all-round excellence. MSG (NCC) Irfan Hady Bin Zuzaini, who was the
Unit Sergeant Major, was also given the Outstanding Cadet Award, which
was given to the top 5% of the cohort.</p>

<p>Our cadets attend milestone activities including Camp Forge for Sec 1
cadets, Camp Steel for Secondary Two cadets as well as the Specialists
Assessment course for Secondary Three cadets. The more outstanding cadets
were also selected to attend the Senior Specialist Leaders Course where
they will take up higher appointments to lead the unit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On 11<sup>th</sup> February 2023, BPGHS had the opportunity to host the
PDS/FSD competition for the West Zone. 9 schools participated in the PDS
competition, and 13 schools participated in the FSD competition. All the
BPGHS cadets were activated to help in the administration and logistics
which turned out to be a good experience for all as it was the first time
that BPGHS host such a competition. BP NCC also organised an Inter-UG soccer
competition in which all the UG enjoyed thoroughly. During the March holidays,
we had our annual camp where we test the leadership of our Cadet Leaders.
The highlights of the camp was Laser Tech and hiking of 12 km from Venus
Avenue to Upper Bukit Timah.</p>

<p>BPNCC was also invited to the Bukit Batok East Community Centre for the
National Day Observance Ceremony and celebration in 2023. Alongside with
the other UGs, the cadets formed a contingent and was inspected by the
Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Ms Rahayu Mahzam. The road was closed for
this event which was attended by the public and the residents. The NCC
also showcased the Precision Drills Squad performance, and the event was
also attended by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment.
The same contingent also participated in the school National Day Parade
and the same squad did a performance thereafter. BPNCC also participated
in other events such as Orienteering, Inter-Unit Sports Competition and
Air Rifle Shooting.</p>

<p>Through these engaging activities, cadets learn to organise and form a
culture that instils discipline and fellowship. BPNCC continues to work
hard to achieve the Unit Recognition Distinction and strives to be the
premier NCC Land unit in the West district.</p>
