<p>The National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) is a Uniformed Group under the
Ministry of Education and Ministry of Home Affairs. The CCA provides a
holistic experience from nurturing values, such as leadership, discipline
and responsibility, to acquiring skills such as first-aid and kayaking.
Events such as drills sessions and parades teach the members to be disciplined,
while outdoor activities such as adventure training camps at Pulau Ubin,
campcraft and tent-pitching give members a chance to develop resilience
and enjoy outdoor experiences. NPCC members also get a chance to experience
policing, learn about the law, be involved in Crime Scene Investigation
techniques and get a chance to shoot with a real revolver. Apart from all
these activities, NPCC members gain leadership abilities in the midst of
grooming their juniors. All in all, NPCC nurtures members into all-rounded
and caring citizens.</p>
