<p>The St John Brigade was founded not just with the primary aim to equip
members with the necessary skills to save lives, but to develop them into
resourceful, skilful and confident individuals.</p>
<p>Triage assessments are often conducted to expose our members to real-life
emergencies. Training sessions focus on four main domains: First Aid, Home
Nursing, Transportation of Casualty (TOC) and Foot drill.</p>
<p>SJB cadets are also sent to various courses under the different groupings
recommended in the Cadet Proficiency Badge scheme to encourage them to
further develop their interest in subjects covered beyond their normal
curriculum. They also learn to develop a strong sense of social awareness
by participating in fund-raising activities such as Flag Days and Walkathons.
We believe that such meaningful CCA experiences contribute to the quality
of school experience for these future leaders.</p>
