<p>The Art Elective Programme (AEP) is offered at selected secondary schools
and junior colleges. Set up in 1984, the AEP provides an enriched environment
for students to realise their creative talents and develop their artistic
vision. In the AEP, the study of Art extends beyond the acquisition of
artistic skills and techniques. It is a journey of artistic expression
that challenges students’ thinking and imagination, fires up their passion
and transforms the way they look at themselves and the world around them.
They will learn new ways to see, make and uncover information. In the process,
their creative sensibilities will be heightened through exploration of
different media such as drawing, painting, illustration, sculpture, ceramics,
photography, installation, video and digital animation.</p>
<p>Bukit Panjang Government High School AEP was set up in 2011. Based on
the 3E (Excite, Engage &amp; Excel) framework, we design and craft our
curriculum. The lessons are modular in approach and the students are exposed
to the various craft types during their lower secondary years. As they
advance to upper secondary levels, their technical skills are further honed
through lessons as well as enrichment workshops conducted by art practitioners
in the respective industries. They will also be prepped on the different
papers in Secondary Three before they advance to Secondary Four.</p>

<p>Besides the modular lessons, students are also given platforms to showcase
their artistic talents. In 2021, the pandemic pushed for a review in the
approach. Our sec 3 AEP students participated in a combined schools workshop
conducted by the School of Art Design and Media (ADM) of Nanyang Technological
University’s (NTU). This was done on a virtual platform.</p>
<p>For the first time, our biennial combined schools’ AEP Exhibition (AEPE)
took on a digital platform. The opening launch took on a news anchor-reporter
theme and the exhibition is curated in a contemporary styled website. The
exhibition is aptly titled D.A.R.E.</p>
<p>Selected sec 1, 2 and 3 AEP participated in a National Day project with
Keat Hong Community Centre (CC). Student made artworks to represent experiences
during this pandemic. These artworks were telecasted and voiced over by
Member of Parliament (MP) Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim as part of Keat Hong
CC’s National Day Celebrations.&nbsp;</p>
