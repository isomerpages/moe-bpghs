<h1>Code for Fun</h1>
<p>In partnership with the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Infocomm Media
Development Authority (IMDA), our Secondary One and Two students participated
in the Code for Fun (CfF) and AI for Fun programmes from 26 to 28 May this
year.
<br>These programmes introduced students to computational thinking and programming
using microcontrollers. Over the 10-hour programme, students also learned
basic coding and design thinking, culminating in the creation and presentation
of their own prototypes to address sustainability-related problems. Some
of the prototypes created by students included a dust sensor, motion-activated
lights, and energy-saving home systems.</p>
<p><strong>Students’ Feedback:</strong>
<br>Lee Wen Xi (2A) - AI for fun was a really fun activity! We learnt how
to code and use AI to make a chatbot. I really enjoyed this activity as
I could work with my friends and still learn at the same time.
<br>
</p>
<p>Dillion Choo and Raphael Tan (2A) - The program was very good, fun and
educational!</p>
<p>Jovian Sim (2A) - The programme was fun and taught me a lot about artificial
intelligence.&nbsp;</p>
