<strong><u>President's Scholar & SAF Scholar 2016 (Natasha Ann Lum)</u></strong>

We heartily congratulate our alumna, Natasha Ann Lum, for attaining the President’s Scholarship and SAF Scholarship this year. Natasha was an outstanding personality in her class. Her form teacher, Ms Trina Tay, recalls that Natasha was both a persuasive speaker and a good writer. Her eloquence had made her stand out as the youngest finalist out of more than 150 adult competitors in 'The Search for a Host for Rediffusion', a talent search for bilingual emcees. It made her a natural choice to emcee multiple school events.

Natasha was also an active member of the National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC). She was the Secondary 3 Squad Commander and had attained the rank of Staff Sergeant. For her leadership and service to the school and to NPCC, she was awarded the Eagles Award for Leadership and the prestigious Singapore Police Force badge.

We are proud of Natasha’s achievements and are confident that she will go on to serve the nation well. Congratulations, Natasha!
