<p>The Sculpture Project was initiated by an Art Teacher, Mr Cheong Weng
Yat, and a local artist, Mr Baet Yoke Kuan in 1999. In order to drive the
messages of the Desired Outcomes of Education (DOE) across to the students,
Mr Cheong suggested the idea of conceptualising the DOE in sculptural forms
to be displayed in the school garden. This not only served to beautify
the school environment, it also stood to remind students and teachers of
the eight DOE. With the pupils’ positive attitude, strong foundation in
design and the support from the Principal then, Ms Tan Lay Choo, this Sculpture
Project became a reality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The designs for the sculpture mainly came from two lower secondary and
one upper secondary art students, namely, Lio Shi Qi Joanne, Soh Ling Na
and Tan Wei Keong.</p>
<p>However, the sculptures, being exposed to the elements over a long period,
not only looked worn as they lost some of their original splendour, they
also became structurally unstable and posed a safety hazard to students.
Hence, the school decided to remove the sculptures and preserve them permanently
in digital form.</p>
