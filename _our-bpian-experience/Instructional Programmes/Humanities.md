<h1>Humanities</h1>
<p>The Humanities department broadens students' perspectives and develops
critical thinking skills through diverse programs within and beyond the
school. Utilising e-pedagogy, students engage in self-directed, collaborative
humanities investigations, with many inquiry stages conducted online.</p>
<p>The Humanities department comprises the disciplines of History, Geography
and Social Studies.</p>
<p><strong>Teaching approaches</strong>
<br>In teaching the humanities, a concept-centric approach is used. Students
attain conceptual understanding and demonstrate their understanding by
drawing on content knowledge to illustrate the concepts.</p>
<p>E-pedagogy is applied through the use of Student Learning Space (SLS)
and flipped classroom to allow students to attain information before curriculum
time. This information serves as prior knowledge that students utilize
for the various activities and discussions during curriculum time. Teachers
also utilize other ICT platforms to allow students equal opportunities
to participate in class as well as receive feedback more instantly.</p>

<p><strong>Authentic learning:</strong>
<br>Students are actively involved in Historical Investigation (HI), Geographical
Investigation (GI) Issues Investigation (II) as well as Performance Task
(PT) as part of their Humanities curriculum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the Inquiry process to study primary and secondary sources, students
draw conclusions and present their findings using different mediums. These
activities provide the opportunities for exploration and for students to
collaborate as teams. They also allow the students to showcase their critical
thinking skills and creativity.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the department sparks interest in the humanities by exposing
students to current affairs through curated assembly talks and organising
interactive events like Amazing Race and virtual tours, blending learning
with competition and real-world exploration. These engage students in real-world
and authentic learning, deepening their understanding of events and concepts.</p>

<p><strong>Stretching students’ potential</strong>
<br>Students who demonstrate keen interest or potential are selected to represent
the school at interschool events such as conferences, Model United Nations
and competitions. Such platforms allow students to deepen their knowledge
of the humanities, and also provide opportunities for students to interact
with students from other schools, broadening their exposure and widening
their social networks.</p>
