<h3>Humanities</h3>
<p>The Humanities department comprises the disciplines of History, Geography
and Social Studies.</p>
<p><strong><u>Teaching approaches</u></strong>
</p>
<p>In teaching the humanities, a concept-centric approach is used. Students
attain conceptual understanding and demonstrate their understanding by
drawing on content knowledge to illustrate the concepts.</p>
<p>E-pedagogy is applied through the use of Student Learning Space (SLS)
and flipped classroom to allow students to attain information before curriculum
time. This information serves as prior knowledge that students utilize
for the various activities and discussions during curriculum time. Teachers
also utilize other platforms to allow students equal opportunities to participate
in class as well as receive feedback more instantly.</p>
<p><strong><u>Authentic learning</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Students are actively involved in Historical Investigation (HI), Geographical
Investigation (GI) Issues Investigation (II) as well as Performance Task
(PT) as part of their Humanities curriculum.</p>
<p>Using the Inquiry process to study primary and secondary sources, students
draw conclusions and present their findings in using different mediums.
These activities provide the opportunities for the students to collaborate
as teams. They also allow the students to showcase their critical thinking
skills and creativity.</p>
<p>The school also organizes learning journeys and humanities interclass
competitions to enthuse the students in their learning.</p>
<p><strong><u>Stretching studentsâ€™ potentials</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Students who show keen interest or potentials are selected to represent
the school at interschool events such as conferences, model United Nations
and competitions. Such platforms allowed the students to deepen their knowledge
of the humanities, it also allowed the students to interact with student
from other schools, widening their social networks.</p>
