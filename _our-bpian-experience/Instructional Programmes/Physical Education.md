<h3>Physical Education</h3>
<p>The Physical Education (PE) Departmentâ€™s programmes are customised for
each level to develop BPians into physically active, mentally resilient
and socially competent individuals. The department adopts a game-centred
approach to teach sports and games. This allows students to learn and develop
their skills progressively, thereby igniting their joy of learning and
developing them to be passionate learners who will pursue an active and
healthy lifestyle. Throughout the four or five years, they are exposed
to a variety of physical activities that will</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>equip them with the breadth of knowledge and skills to pursue an active
and healthy lifestyle even beyond school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>give them many opportunities to think critically, communicate positively
with others and work as a team in decision making.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>allow them to act on their personal values and demonstrate positive emotions
and social behaviour, as well as leadership qualities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through a balanced and well-designed curriculum, delivered through effective
pedagogies and meaningful assessment, students will better appreciate what
they do during PE lessons and see the value of physical education beyond
just having fun.</p>
