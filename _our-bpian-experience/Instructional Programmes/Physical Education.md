<h3>Physical Education</h3>
<p>The Physical Education (PE) Department's programmes are customised at
each level to develop BPians into physically active, mentally resilient
and socially competent individuals. The department adopts a game-centred
approach to teach sports and games to enhance students' 21st-century competencies.</p>
<p>This allows students to learn and develop their skills progressively,
thereby igniting their joy of learning and developing them to be passionate
learners who will pursue an active and healthy lifestyle. Throughout the
four or five years, they are exposed to a variety of physical activities
that will</p>

and healthy lifestyle even beyond school.</p>
</li>
<li>

with others and work as a team in decision making.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow them to act on their personal values and demonstrate positive emotions
and social behaviour, as well as leadership qualities.</p>
