<p>The Physical Education (PE) Department's programmes are customised at
each level to develop BPians into physically active, mentally resilient
and socially competent individuals. The department adopts a game-centred
approach to teach sports and games to enhance students' 21st-century competencies.</p>

thereby igniting their joy of learning and developing them to be passionate
learners who will pursue an active and healthy lifestyle. Throughout the
