<h3>Mother Tongue</h3>
<p>The Mother Tongue Department seeks to offer a range of student learning
experiences for purposeful and meaningful student engagement, with the
aim to spark interest in the learning of their mother tongue languages,
and support student learning for deep subject mastery.</p>
<h4>Chinese Language Unit</h4>
<p><strong>Chinese Language and Higher Chinese &nbsp; 热爱母语 弘扬文化</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><u>Use of Pedagogical Approaches</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Through the use of suitable innovative pedagogical approaches such as
the Inquiry-based Learning and Questions-based Learning tasks, the Chinese
Unit aims to promote authentic learning and ignite the joy of learning
among the students as they grasp the essential knowledge and skills in
the mother tongue languages. Apart from the rigorous performance tasks,
we also provide timely and constructive feedback to boost our students’
learning, and at the same time, leverage different ICT tools, such as Student
Learning Space (SLS), to enhance their oral communication skills.</p>
<p><strong><u>Stretching of the students’ abilities beyond the classroom</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Unit's pedagogical approaches are supplemented with numerous platforms
to stretch students beyond meeting syllabus requirements. As an illustration,students&nbsp;
are strongly encouraged to sit for&nbsp;the Chinese Proficiency Test (汉语水平考试)
which is an international standardized test for Chinese language proficiency.
Over the years,HSK scores have&nbsp; become a requirement for international
students to prove their Chinese language proficiencies if they would like
to apply for scholarships in the top universities of China. Moreover, students
also have the opportunities of participating in competitions such as&nbsp;
“Script It Right” Chinese Radio Drama Script Writing Competition, the National
Secondary Schools Translation Competition, “Global Village” Children &amp;
Youths Bilingual Speech Competition, the National Chinese Poem-Writing
Competition and the National Chinese Challenge.</p>

<p><strong><u>Mother Tongue Fortnight Programme</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Across all levels, students participate in the Mother Tongue Fortnight
Programme which provides them with the opportunity of learning decorative
art such as Chinese calligraphy and painting, Chinese tea appreciation,
and martial arts like Wushu and Silat. These programmes and workshops would
help to deepen the students’ learning of Chinese language and culture.</p>
<p><strong><u>Cultural Exposure &amp; theatrical experience (武中戏曲团)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Apart from the instructional programmes, the Unit&nbsp;aims to promote
and strengthen our students’ sense of cultural heritage and identity through
a variety of programmes such as the Chinese New Year Celebration, Mid-Autumn
Festival Celebration and the Cultural Performance.</p>

experience. The Chinese Opera Ensemble has presented a myriad of productions
