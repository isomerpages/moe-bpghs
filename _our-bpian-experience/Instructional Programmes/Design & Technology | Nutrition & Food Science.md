<h3>Design &amp; Technology</h3>
<p>The Design and Technology (D&amp;T) Unit aims to develop design thinking
skills and give students opportunities to apply design knowledge through
the D&amp;T curriculum’s 3E Framework (Excite, Engage and Excel).</p>
<p>To stimulate interest among our lower secondary students in D&amp;T, students
will be introduced to the design process and be given opportunities to
experience the following activities: freehand sketching, ideation of design
and prototype making.</p>
<p>To engage and develop our upper secondary students to excel at the national
examination, students will execute, in greater depth, the five stages of
the design process. They will also learn comprehensive practical processes
in the workshop and gain relevant and comprehensive knowledge of the various
areas in technology.</p>
<p>Examples of students’ work:</p>

<h1>Nutrition and Food Science</h1>
<p>Nutrition and Food Science aims to educate students on consumerism, financial
planning in daily living and the importance of nutrition for long-term
health.. It is a compulsory subject for all lower secondary students, with
the exception of the AEP students.</p>
<p>The lesson syllabus focuses on how individuals can optimise their skills
and resources to meet their physical, mental, social and economic needs.
Through various lesson activities, students will acquire multiple life
skills, such as making wise decisions on choosing healthier food ingredients,
consuming the necessary nutrients to maintain good health, and managing
finances to solve real world problems.</p>
<p>The Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) students are given the choice
to offer this subject at the upper secondary level.</p>
