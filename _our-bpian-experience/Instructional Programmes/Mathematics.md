<h3>Mathematics</h3>
<p><strong><u>Vision</u></strong>
<br>Every BPian a future-ready, self-directed and critical thinker.</p>
<p><strong><u>Mission</u></strong>
<br>To cultivate the joy of learning and 21st&nbsp;century competencies through
student-focused quality instruction and assessment.</p>
<p><strong><u>Department Focus</u></strong>
<br>The department holds a strong belief that every BPian can learn and we
seek to help every BPian enjoy learning within and beyond the classroom.
These beliefs guide the design and implementation of our curriculum for
Mathematics, Computer Application (CPA), Elements of Business Studies (EBS)
and Principles of Accounts (POA).</p>
<p><strong><u>Enhancing Learning Experiences</u></strong>
<br>The Mathematics Department continued to embark on an exciting journey
towards enhancing the learning experience for our students. We have conducted
many open classroom sessions to fellow teachers in the other department,
inviting them to witness firsthand the magic of mathematical discovery.
This allows for constructive feedback and constructive dialogues that drive
continuous improvement within the department.</p>
<p><strong><u>Exploring Innovative Pedagogies</u></strong>
<br>Differentiated instruction recognizes that students come to us with diverse
backgrounds, abilities, and learning styles. The department have learned
from workshops to tailor our teaching methods to meet individual student
needs. By customizing instruction, we aim to engage every learner effectively,
ensuring that no student is left behind while challenging those who excel.</p>
<p>Through differentiated instruction, we offer varied pathways for students
to explore mathematical concepts. We provide additional resources for those
who require extra support and advanced challenges for those who crave more
depth. By recognizing and valuing the uniqueness of each student, we create
an inclusive and nurturing environment where everyone can thrive.</p>
<p><strong><u>Applying Learning Beyond the Classrooms</u></strong>
<br>With the strong belief that every BPian should be given the opportunity
to demonstrate and develop their Mathematical ability, students are encouraged
to participate in competitions such as the Singapore Mathematical Olympiad
and ICAS competition. Our students from the normal course also take part
in the IGNITE Skills Challenge and All Singapore Secondary Mathematics
Competition For Normal Course pitting their knowledge against more than
800 participants.</p>
