<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p>Please be informed of the process for notifying the school about your
child’s/ward’s absence from school.</p>
<p>If your child/ward is unable to attend school, please complete the Notification
of Absence Form at <a href="http://go.gov.sg/bpghsnoa" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">go.gov.sg/bpghsnoa</a> as soon as possible.
This link will also be made available on the school website under LINKS
-&gt; For Parents.</p>
<p>Upon your child’s/ward’s return to school, they are required to submit
a hard copy of their Medical Certificate or a parent’s letter (up to three
per semester) to their Form Teacher.</p>
<p>Please note that you will receive an automated SMS notification at 9:00
AM each day your child/ward is absent from school. Completing and submitting
the Notification of Absence Form does not cancel the daily SMS notifications.</p>
<p>If you believe the information in the automated SMS is incorrect, please
do not be alarmed. You may contact the BPGHS General Office at 6769 1031
to verify the details.</p>
<p>Thank you for your cooperation in ensuring a smooth process for managing
student absences.</p>
