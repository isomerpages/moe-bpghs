			<p><strong>1. What is the indicative score range of BPGHS based on the 2021 cohort?</strong><br><strong>Ans:</strong> Express: 6-11 <br> Normal (Academic): 21-22 <br> Normal (Technical): 25-26</p>
      <p><strong>2. Should I select BPGHS as one of my choices if I just met the minimum requirements of the indicative score range?</strong><br><strong>Ans:</strong> The indicative score range is calculated based on the range of T-score of the 2021 cohort. It should be noted that the Cut Off Point (COP) varies from year to year. One way to go about choosing a school would be to list down schools that you are keen to join and check whether their COP is near your T-score. You can then put these schools down in your application in descending order of their COP. That should put you in a good position to get into a school that you are keen to join.</p>
			<p><strong> 3. My child qualified for the Express stream, can he/she apply for the Normal (Academic) stream in BPGHS?</strong><br><strong>Ans:</strong> Your child will not be able to apply to join a N(A) course in a Secondary School.</p>
			<p><strong>4. I understand that BPGHS will be implementing Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB) in 2022. How will this affect my child if he/ she is enrolled into the school for Secondary 1 in 2022?</strong><br><strong>Ans:</strong> There are 2 main aspects of FSBB that will be implemented. Firstly, all form classes will comprise students from all academic streams. Secondly, students doing the Normal (Academic) or Normal (Technical) course will be offered the option to do Humanities subjects at a more demanding level at Secondary 2, if they meet the criteria. <br>You can find more information on FSBB on the school website.</p>
			<p><strong>5. What are the daily school hours at BPGHS?</strong><br><strong>Ans:</strong> School starts at 7:30 a.m. and ends at 1:40 p.m. / 2:40 p.m. for Monday to Thursday and 12:40 p.m. on Friday. Students will be expected to stay back after curriculum hours on some days for after-school activities such as CCA, enrichment activities and remedial / supplementary lessons. As announced by MOE in 2020, all secondary schools will be implementing regular Home-Based Learning (HBL) by 2022. Students will not be required to report to school on a specific day every fortnight, and will be learning from home instead. More details will be communicated at a later date.</p>
			<p><strong>6. Will there be any physical Open House this year?</strong><br><strong>Ans:</strong> Due to the safe management measures, we will not be having a physical Open House this year at BPGHS.</p>
			<p><strong>7. What is the duration of the recess?</strong><br><strong>Ans:</strong> The recess is 30 minutes long.</p>
			<p><strong>8. What is the average price and variety of food sold in the school canteen?</strong><br><strong>Ans:</strong> A typical meal (without drinks) in the school canteen costs between $2.50 and $3.50. The canteen comprises 4 Chinese food stalls, 2 halal food stalls and 1 drink stall.</p>
