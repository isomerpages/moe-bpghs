			<p><strong>1. What is the indicative score range of BPGHS based on the 2021 cohort?</strong><br><strong>Ans:</strong> Express: 6-11 <br> Normal (Academic): 21-22 <br> Normal (Technical): 25-26</p>
      <p><strong>2. Should I select BPGHS as one of my choices if I just met the minimum requirements of the indicative score range?</strong><br><strong>Ans:</strong> The indicative score range is calculated based on the range of T-score of the 2021 cohort. It should be noted that the Cut Off Point (COP) varies from year to year. One way to go about choosing a school would be to list down schools that you are keen to join and check whether their COP is near your T-score. You can then put these schools down in your application in descending order of their COP. That should put you in a good position to get into a school that you are keen to join.</p>
			<p><strong> 3. My child qualified for the Express stream, can he/she apply for the Normal (Academic) stream in BPGHS?</strong><br><strong>Ans:</strong> Your child will not be able to apply to join a N(A) course in a Secondary School.</p>
			<p><strong>4. I understand that BPGHS will be implementing Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB) in 2022. How will this affect my child if he/ she is enrolled into the school for Secondary 1 in 2022?</strong><br><strong>Ans:</strong> There are 2 main aspects of FSBB that will be implemented. Firstly, all form classes will comprise students from all academic streams. Secondly, students doing the Normal (Academic) or Normal (Technical) course will be offered the option to do Humanities subjects at a more demanding level at Secondary 2, if they meet the criteria. <br>You can find more information on FSBB on the school website.</p>
			<p><strong>5.

			<p><strong>8. How many assessments will a student have for each subject for a year</strong><br><strong>Ans:</strong> As announced by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in Sept 2018, all students will not have more than one weighted assessment per subject per school term. In BPGHS, for Secondary 1 – 3, there will not be any Mid Year Examinations. Students will have 1 weighted assessment in each term for Term 1 – 3, and an End of Year Examination in Term 4. The school also monitors the academic progress of students using other non-weighted assessments, such as project work and presentations.
			<p><strong>9. Are students expected to purchase a laptop for learning?<br></strong><strong>Ans:</strong> On 28 June 2020, MOE announced that every secondary school student will be equipped with a personal learning device by the end of 2021 in an effort to raise the country's digital literacy. All students in the school will be using devices of the same model and the purchasing of the devices will be done in school. A separate briefing will be conducted on this at a later date.

			<p><strong>11. What is the arrangement for students doing subjects at a more demanding level under Subject-Based Banding?</strong><br><strong>Ans:</strong> As far as possible, the school will arrange for this group of students to have their lessons together with their peers from the other stream to encourage more interactions among students across different streams.
			<p><strong> 12. Will students be allowed to switch to a more demanding stream if they do well after they join the school?</strong><br><strong>Ans:</strong> Students may be allowed to switch to a more demanding stream if they meet the criteria at the end of the year of study.

The trips organised range from academic trips (e.g. Geography) to non-academic/ student leadership / CCA trips. However, any overseas trips are currently suspended due to the covid-19 situation</p>
			<p><strong>15. If my child does not take higher Mother Tongue in primary school, can he/she take higher Mother Tongue in secondary school?

The programme aims to nurture promising students to attain a high level of language proficiency in Malay, enhance their understanding of Malay literature and develop academically able students to become effectively bilingual so as to better serve the needs of our nation. The 2-year programme (Secondary 3 and 4) is for students who offer ‘O’ Level Literature in Malay, in either full or elective. MLEP activities include language and cultural camps, overseas immersion trips, language symposiums and enrichment workshops on creative writing, drama script writing, public speaking, translation and journalism.
