### Code for Fun

![](/images/CFF1.jpeg)

The Code for Fun Enrichment Programme (offered jointly by IMDA and MOE) is offered to all MOE primary and secondary schools. The programme includes learning of computational thinking concepts using visual-based programming language, combining it with robotic kits and/or microcontrollers, to create an engaging coding experience for the students.

The Code for Fun Enrichment Programme aims to:  

*   facilitate the exposure of a large base of students to coding and computational thinking; and
*   help build an entire generation of workforce inculcated with basic coding and computational thinking skills.

All Secondary One students of BPGHS are exposed to various forms of coding and robotics to instill in them problem solving skills and creativity. At the start of Term 1, students begin to use Lego Mindstorms EV3 System to learn the fundamentals of good robot construction and programming. In Term 2, they then move on to explore concepts of drone flight mechanism and application of drone technology in real world, through fun and experiential learning techniques. In Semester 2, students will focus on using the UiFlow platform to build a sustainable and accessible enhancement prototype such as a Smart Home Improvement Gadget, using the IoT enabled M5GO microcontrollers.
