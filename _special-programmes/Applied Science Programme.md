In 2017, the school piloted and developed the Applied Science Programme (ASP), as part of the schoolâ€™s effort to bring authentic learning into the curriculum. Under the year-long programme, our Secondary Two students, were exposed to the research process, anchored on urban farming experiments. They also learned basic electronics and programming through an in-house Arduino curriculum. Following the completion of the research and programming modules, they then had a chance to apply their learning in designing a prototype greenhouse system to improve plant yield. The programme ultimately culminated in our own ASP Science Fair where students showcased their year-long work.

Through each of the research, programming and design modules, the students were given the chance to extend and sharpen their classroom knowledge and skills. Within the context of urban farming, the students looked at Biology concepts of&nbsp;_photosynthesis_&nbsp;and&nbsp;_plant growth_, and Chemistry concepts of&nbsp;_acid/alkali_&nbsp;and&nbsp;_air pollution_. As they acquired programming know-how, they also had the chance to extend what they learnt about electrical systems and sound, through the many electronic components that they worked with.

In 2020, the ASP curriculum was reviewed and updated to get students to consider Singapore's water challenges. The students looked at possible water challenges that may be faced by the country and came up with creative solutions to hypothetical problems. They came up with various digital artefacts and prototypes that they envisioned could help alleviate water issues. In light of the pandemic, a virtual science fair in which videos of their project were showcased to all classes was held instead.

ASP is interdisciplinary and enables the students to enjoy Science out of the confines of the classroom. We seek to ignite the joy of learning in each of our students, help students to truly enjoy the many wonders of Science and to develop the passionate learners we want our students to be, as encapsulated in our vision.
