In 2019 November, 29 BPians went on a cultural immersion trip to Xi’an, China. During the trip, the students were engaged in various fun-filled and enriching activities, such as learning Chinese calligraphy and T’ai chi. These authentic learning experiences provided them with exposure to the rich cultural heritage of China.
  

Xi’an was the capital for several of the most important dynasties in Chinese history, and the students had the opportunity to visit various famous symbolic attractions in the city, which include the Terracotta Army of Emperor Qin Shi Huang and the Xi’an Museum. Apart from the cultural exposure, the students also had a great time interacting with the local students during the school visit. The learning journey indeed broadened their horizons and left these BPians with some delightful cultural experiences.
