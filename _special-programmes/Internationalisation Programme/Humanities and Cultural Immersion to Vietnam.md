<h2>Humanities Learning and Cultural Immersion to Vietnam 2023</h2>
<p>The Humanities department brought a group of Secondary Three students
to Vietnam for an exchange programme at the end of the year. The teachers
and school leaders made a recce trip earlier this year to link up with
our partner school, Thanh Quan Secondary School, in Vietnam who subsequently
came over to our school for a visit. In November, the department brought
thirty students to Hanoi, Vietnam. The students had a cultural exchange
with students from two schools, Thanh Quan Secondary School and The Dewey
International School. They also visited historical sites and studied the
geographical features of tourism and nature conservation in Hanoi.</p>
