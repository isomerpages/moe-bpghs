The volleyball team embarked on a sports learning and cultural immersion trip to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia from 17 to 21 December 2019. Even though the duration of the trip was short, it was time well spent as all the objectives of the trip were met! The players sparred against quality opponents and had the opportunity to attend trainings conducted by the local coaches. They were put through various training methods, which will definitely help them in their preparations for the upcoming National School Games. Outside the court, the team bonded through various cultural activities as they tried their hand in making their own pewter and experienced batik painting for the first time. Overall, the players had a rewarding experience and created memories that they will hold close to their hearts in the years to come.
