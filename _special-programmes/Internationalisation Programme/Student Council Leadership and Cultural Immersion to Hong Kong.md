From 7 to 12 June 2019, 21 Student Councillors and 3 Teachers visited Hong Kong and embarked on an exploration of what it means to live in a multicultural and globalised world, and to think deeply about all the problems and potentials associated with it. Neighbourhoods, communities, restaurants, corporations and even a theme park were turned into spaces of inquiry and learning.

  

Some of the highlights of the trip include a one-day workshop at Disneyland to broaden students' perspectives on the unique challenges and opportunities global cities face, a walking tour of a South Asian community to understand how minority groups live in Hong Kong, and a visit to South China Morning Post to learn about the role of newspapers in shaping global thought on regional issues.

  

We are extremely grateful to all who have shared their stories, histories, experiences and knowledge with us, and we will, in own our ways, try to lead our community and create more inclusive spaces amidst our multicultural and globalised Singapore!
