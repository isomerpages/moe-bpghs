The Art Elective Programme (AEP) is offered at selected secondary schools and junior colleges. Set up in 1984, the AEP provides an enriched environment for students to realise their creative talents and develop their artistic vision. In the AEP, the study of Art extends beyond the acquisition of artistic skills and techniques. It is a journey of artistic expression that challenges students’ thinking and imagination, fires up their passion and transforms the way they look at themselves and the world around them. They will learn new ways to see, make and uncover information. In the process, their creative sensibilities will be heightened through exploration of different media such as drawing, painting, illustration, sculpture, ceramics, photography, installation, video and digital animation.

  

Bukit Panjang Government High School AEP was set up in 2011. Based on the 3E (Excite, Engage & Excel) framework, we design and craft our curriculum. The lessons are modular in approach and the students are exposed to the various craft types during their lower secondary years. As they advance to upper secondary levels, their technical skills are further honed through lessons as well as enrichment workshops conducted by art practitioners in the respective industries. They will also be prepped on the different papers in Secondary Three before they advance to Secondary Four.

Besides the modular lessons, students are also given platforms to showcase their artistic talents. In 2021, the pandemic pushed for a review in the approach. Our sec 3 AEP students participated in a combined schools workshop conducted by the School of Art Design and Media (ADM) of Nanyang Technological University’s (NTU). This was done on a virtual platform.  

  

For the first time, our biennial combined schools’ AEP Exhibition (AEPE) took on a digital platform. The opening launch took on a news anchor-reporter theme and the exhibition is curated in a contemporary styled website. The exhibition is aptly titled D.A.R.E. You may visit the exhibition **[here](https://aepe2021.com/About-AEP)**. 

  

Selected sec 1, 2 and 3 AEP participated in a National Day project with Keat Hong Community Centre (CC). Student made artworks to represent experiences during this pandemic. These artworks were telecasted and voiced over by Member of Parliament (MP) Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim as part of Keat Hong CC’s National Day Celebrations.
