### Educational & Career Guidance
  
  

**Education and Career Guidance (ECG)** is about equipping students with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to make decisions at each key education stage for successful transition from school to further education or work, and hence to plan and manage their career pathways and learning throughout their lives.  

  

**In BPGHS, we focus on:**

*   Awareness of Self (Strengths, Interests, Values and Skills)
*   Awareness of the various professions and opportunities in the world of work
*   Awareness of relevant courses of study and educational pathways
*   Enhance ownership and planning of own education and career pathways

  

For ECG to be effective, one of the key enablers is to develop in students a **future-ready mindset**, which comprises the following:

*   Embracing the concept of open exploration (to explore the unfamiliar and unknown)
*   Challenging preconceived ideas/assumptions and to embrace new learning
*   Inculcating the spirit of continuous learning for self-improvement
*   Having the joy of learning
*   Be inspired and establish a vision for self
