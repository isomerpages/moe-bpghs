National Education (NE) plays an important role in getting students to make sense of what it means to be a Singaporean.  

  

In an increasingly connected and complex world today, it is essential to help our students navigate their own values and beliefs in relation to ideas of national citizenship and identity. This is the reason NE commemorative events are anchored by the NE ambassadors nominated in every class. Be it Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day or National Day, the NE Ambassadors play a pivotal role in the respective assembly programmes. They come together to conceptualise the programmes, carry out research and come up with innovative ways to present their findings and learning to the entire school population during the commemoration.

To further enhance students’ understanding of the pertinent issues surrounding them, the NE Ambassadors also embark on learning journeys which include learning about different faiths at various religious sites, participating in interfaith dialogue, attending the annual Camp Ignite camp where they learn about racial harmony and even visiting the Parliament House to observe a parliament proceeding.

There are also cohort experiences such as the Secondary One and Three Heritage Trails, the Secondary Three NRIC Presentation Ceremony and the NE quiz for the different levels.

  

With the above platforms, we seek to provide opportunities for our students to experience, understand and appreciate Singapore’s socio-cultural, geo-political, historical and economic contexts, which in turn nurture our students to be responsible citizens with a love for Singapore.
