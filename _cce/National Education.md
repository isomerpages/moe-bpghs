### National Education
  
National Education (NE) is an important part of the curriculum where we educate our students to be good citizens and make sense of what it means to be a Singpaorean.  The NE programme in our school seeks to provide our students with the knowledge, skills, and values to become critical thinkers who are socially aware and engaged in discussing the contemporary issues. 

  

In BPGHS, the NE ambassadors are given the opportunities to lead and plan activities for BPians to understand the nation’s past and the significance of the NE commemorative days (namely Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day).  Through these whole-school experiences, we hope to inspire BPians to make sense of their identity; and to understand the history and the realities of Singapore.

Through the CCE curriculum, BPians get to discuss contemporary issues.  Through these discussion, BPians will get to develop critical thinking skills and perspective-taking kills while understanding the local, the regional and the global issues.   Other than the curriculum, the school also plans learning journeys for BPians to learn more about the history of Singapore and its development.

There are also cohort experiences such as the Secondary One and Three Heritage Trails, the Secondary Three NRIC Presentation Ceremony and the NE quiz for the different levels.

  

With the above platforms, we seek to provide opportunities for our students to experience, understand and appreciate Singapore’s socio-cultural, geo-political, historical and economic contexts, which in turn nurture our students to be responsible citizens with a love for Singapore.
