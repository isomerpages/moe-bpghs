In BPGHS, our **vison** is to develop every BPian to be an Inspiring Leader, who exemplify and lead in serving others in the school and community. Our **mission** is to develop leaders with a heart to serve, by nurturing BPians to be anchored in school values and equipped with 21C competencies.  
  
  
**Philosophy of SLD in BPGHS**  

*   Every BPian should be developed as a leader

*   Leadership is not just positional, but also dispositional.
*   Every student possesses his/her unique blend of abilities, inclinations and talents. Thus, he/she is able to make a positive difference within his/her sphere of influence, and thereby be a leader.

*   Leadership is values-driven

*   Student Leadership Development needs to be grounded in sound values to enable student leaders to lead others to achieve goals in an ethical way.

*   Leadership should be about effecting positive change on behalf of others and society

*   BPGHS aims to develop every BPian to be inspiring leaders, anchored in values and with a heart to serve.
*   Student Leadership Development is a purposeful and collaborative process that fosters social change for the common good.

<p>1. Our Student Leadership Programmes are underpinned by:</p>






| School Values: | These ensure the words and actions undertaken by students are based on sound moral values and motives to have a positive impact on others. |
|---|---|
| Social and Emotional Competencies: | These enable the students to manage themselves and others and engage in responsible decision making. |
| 21st Century Competencies: | These enable the students to face the challenges of the future. |
| The Leadership Challenge Model (TLC): (see Annex A below) | TLC by Kouzes & Posner serves as the fundamental basis for the design of all SLD programmes. The five exemplary practices of leadership provide the leadership development focus for each dimension of leadership development. |
| Service Learning (through ViA): (see Annex B) | Students carry out Values-in-Action (VIA) projects using the service-learning approach which combines service to the community with student learning in a way that improves both the student and community. There is an equal emphasis on helping communities and providing valid learning experiences to students. |



 
<p>2. The Student Leadership Development Framework calls for leadership directed towards a greater purpose than self, which is ‘service’ beyond the personal needs to include the needs of the school and the community, as depicted at the core of the framework. The framework is grounded in the belief that every leadership effort should culminate in a positive impact on others, which can consist of their peers, school or the wider community.</p>

<p>3.  The framework describes an interaction between three dimensions of Student Leadership Development – Self-Leadership, Team Leadership and Thought Leadership. The essence of each dimension of leadership is as follows:</p>




| Self-Leadership: | Awareness of one’s own strengths and talents and rootedness in sound values is the basis of strong leadership for service. |
|---|---|
| Team Leadership: | Students need to learn how to work collaboratively with others to effect change for the betterment of others. |
| Thought Leadership: | The ability to envision a future and inspire and mobilise others to serve together. |




The framework takes reference from the four elements of critical consciousness development (Cipolle, 2010, p.7), which are:

*   developing a deeper awareness of self
*   developing a deeper awareness and broader perspective of others
*   developing a deeper awareness and broader perspective of social issues
*   seeing one’s potential to make change

It also emphasises the experiential learning process of leadership among students, as reflected by the dual-headed arrows around the three dimensions of leadership. It encourages the continual process of service and reflection, deepening the growth of oneself in any of the dimensions in which one is in.  
  

<p>4.  The outer-most ring represents the three key groups of stakeholders that are involved in the Student Leadership Programmes — Personal, School and the Community.</p>

  
The school leverages community resources and expertise of external partners to provide the necessary training and opportunities to our students. As leadership development is a continual and directed journey, teacher guidance and mentorship is critical in providing the impetus for successful development of leadership values, skills and knowledge in students.

**Student-initiated Activities (SiA)** 

Student-initiated Activities (SiA) is one of the key platforms for students to develop their leadership skills. Students work in groups or as a class to propose projects in support of a good cause. SiA provides opportunities for students to build team spirit and develop the entrepreneurial dare, as well as a greater appetite for risk-taking and experimentation.  
  
BPians who are keen to make a positive impact on their lives of others in the school or community may launch a SiA project by gathering interested peers and obtaining the endorsement from the school SLD team for implementation.  
  
The following outlines the key processes for SiA:  
  
**Stage 1:** Initiation  
**Stage 2:** Assessment for Refinements and Approval  
**Stage 3:** Implementation  
**Stage 4:** Post-implementation

**National Youth Achievement Award (NYAA)**

The National Youth Achievement Award (NYAA) Youth Leadership Development Programme is an exciting self-development programme for young people between the ages of 13 and 30 years old. It is a holistic, balanced and non-competitive programme of voluntary leisure time activities, designed to provide our young people with a platform to develop personal qualities and skills to make a difference to themselves, their communities and the world. The new NYAA programme is designed in line with the Ministry of Education’s Levels of Attainment, focusing on effort and merit of the individual.  
  
There are three levels in the NYAA Programme (The Gold award is not featured here):  
  
**Bronze Level**: For those who are 13 and under 30 years old  
Minimum period of involvement: 6 months  
  
**Silver Level:** For those who are 15 and under 30 years old  
Minimum period of involvement: 12 months  
  
The NYAA Programme has three key components, which all participants are required to complete, namely:  
  
**Service Learning (Touching Lives, Making a Difference)**  

This component recognizes young people’s development as socially responsible citizens who understand the issues faced by the community and explore how they can contribute actively to find a solution. They can choose to undertake a Values-In-Action project or any community service projects of their interest.


<u>Objective:</u>

To learn how to give useful service to others in the community and to understand the meaning behind voluntary service.  
  
**Bronze:** At least 20 hours of regular activities spread over a minimum period of 4 months.  
**Silver** : At least 40 hours of regular activities spread over a minimum period of 8 months.  
  
**Outdoor Appreciation (To be at Ease with Nature)**

Outdoor learning supports the development of confidence building as young people are placed in unfamiliar environments outside of the classroom. It also develops young people’s problem-solving skills, enhances teamwork, strengthens understanding of the natural environment and inculcates in young people a sense of stewardship for our environment.  
  
<u>Objective:</u>

To be at ease with nature and develop stewardship for our environment.  
  
**Bronze:** At least 15 hours of outdoor activities with a specific learning goal.  
**Silver:** At least 24 hours of outdoor activities with a specific learning goal.  
  
**Healthy Living (Physical & Mental Wellness)**

Healthy living aims to develop and maintain a healthy lifestyle that allows us to get through our daily activities. It also hopes to develop a healthy body and mind. Our behavior has a significant impact on our wellness and adapting healthy habits with a balanced diet and exercise while avoiding destructive habits such as tobacco, drugs and alcohol will improve both our physical and emotional well-being.  
  
<u>Objective:</u>
To develop physical and mental wellness through healthy living.  
  
**Bronze:** At least 24 hours of regular activities spread over a period of 6 months.  
**Silver:** At least 32 hours of regular activities spread over a period of 12 months.  
  
BPians are strongly encouraged to participate in the National Youth Achievement Award (NYAA).  

* Sec 1 and 2: NYAA Bronze Award
*   Sec 3 and 4: NYAA Silver Award

After the completion of the NYAA programme, BPians will receive a certificate mailed to their school/home in recognition of their efforts.
