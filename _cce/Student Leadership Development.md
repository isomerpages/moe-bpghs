In BPGHS, our **vison** is to develop every BPian to be an Inspiring Leader, who exemplify and lead in serving others in the school and community. Our **mission** is to develop leaders with a heart to serve, by nurturing BPians to be anchored in school values and equipped with 21C competencies.  
  
  
**Philosophy of SLD in BPGHS**  

*   Every BPian should be developed as a leader

*   Leadership is not just positional, but also dispositional.
*   Every student possesses his/her unique blend of abilities, inclinations and talents. Thus, he/she is able to make a positive difference within his/her sphere of influence, and thereby be a leader.

*   Leadership is values-driven

*   Student Leadership Development needs to be grounded in sound values to enable student leaders to lead others to achieve goals in an ethical way.

*   Leadership should be about effecting positive change on behalf of others and society

*   BPGHS aims to develop every BPian to be inspiring leaders, anchored in values and with a heart to serve.
*   Student Leadership Development is a purposeful and collaborative process that fosters social change for the common good.
