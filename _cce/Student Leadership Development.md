In BPGHS, our **vison** is to develop every BPian to be an Inspiring Leader, who exemplify and lead in serving others in the school and community. Our **mission** is to develop leaders with a heart to serve, by nurturing BPians to be anchored in school values and equipped with 21C competencies.  
  
  
**Philosophy of SLD in BPGHS**  

*   Every BPian should be developed as a leader

*   Leadership is not just positional, but also dispositional.
*   Every student possesses his/her unique blend of abilities, inclinations and talents. Thus, he/she is able to make a positive difference within his/her sphere of influence, and thereby be a leader.

*   Leadership is values-driven

*   Student Leadership Development needs to be grounded in sound values to enable student leaders to lead others to achieve goals in an ethical way.

*   Leadership should be about effecting positive change on behalf of others and society

*   BPGHS aims to develop every BPian to be inspiring leaders, anchored in values and with a heart to serve.
*   Student Leadership Development is a purposeful and collaborative process that fosters social change for the common good.

<p>1. Our Student Leadership Programmes are underpinned by:</p>






| School Values: | These ensure the words and actions undertaken by students are based on sound moral values and motives to have a positive impact on others. |
|---|---|
| Social and Emotional Competencies: | These enable the students to manage themselves and others and engage in responsible decision making. |
| 21st Century Competencies: | These enable the students to face the challenges of the future. |
| The Leadership Challenge Model (TLC): (see Annex A below) | TLC by Kouzes & Posner serves as the fundamental basis for the design of all SLD programmes. The five exemplary practices of leadership provide the leadership development focus for each dimension of leadership development. |
| Service Learning (through ViA): (see Annex B) | Students carry out Values-in-Action (VIA) projects using the service-learning approach which combines service to the community with student learning in a way that improves both the student and community. There is an equal emphasis on helping communities and providing valid learning experiences to students. |



 
<p>2. The Student Leadership Development Framework calls for leadership directed towards a greater purpose than self, which is ‘service’ beyond the personal needs to include the needs of the school and the community, as depicted at the core of the framework. The framework is grounded in the belief that every leadership effort should culminate in a positive impact on others, which can consist of their peers, school or the wider community.</p>

<p>3.  The framework describes an interaction between three dimensions of Student Leadership Development – Self-Leadership, Team Leadership and Thought Leadership. The essence of each dimension of leadership is as follows:</p>




| Self-Leadership: | Awareness of one’s own strengths and talents and rootedness in sound values is the basis of strong leadership for service. |
|---|---|
| Team Leadership: | Students need to learn how to work collaboratively with others to effect change for the betterment of others. |
| Thought Leadership: | The ability to envision a future and inspire and mobilise others to serve together. |
