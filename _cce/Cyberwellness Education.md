Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to the positive well-being of Internet users. It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of how to protect oneself in cyberspace. The focus of CW is about helping students to become responsible digital learners. When navigating cyberspace, students should demonstrate respect for self and others and practise safe and responsible use. Students should also be a positive peer influence by harnessing technology for collaboration, learning and productivity, as well as advocating positive use of technology for the good of the community.  
  
On top of their CCE lessons, the school also organise level wide programmes to reinforce the importance of CW and its messages. The cyberwellness workshop hopes to deepen the learning of cyber wellness and new media literacy. Students gain knowledge in the following subject matter: Online Aggression, Cyber Bullying & Media Violence and Cyber Crime. Through the programme, students understand the consequences of Cybercrime or Cyberbullying and also develop and share with their peers their individualised action plans to realise their personal goals on Cyber Wellness. The media literacy workshop for the Seconday Two students focus on equipping participants with fundamental media literacy processing skills to use various types of media, and to apply to a wide range of age-relevant social issues like Internet Addiction & Digital Distractions, Fake News & Viral Content and Appropriate Online Expression.  
  
There are also Cyberwellness Ambassors in each class who undergo the appropriate training workshopsÂ  to advocate the importance of CW and its messages to their peers in school.
