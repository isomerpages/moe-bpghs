### Cyberwellness Education
  
Technology is becoming increasingly pervasive in our world.  While we appreciate the instant connectivity and access to information, knowledge and opinions, it is important to equip BPians with the critical thinking skills to determine what is right and to act responsibly within the cyberspace.  

  

The Cyber Wellness programme focuses on the positive well-being of BPians. The aim of the programme is to equip BPians with the knowledge and skills to harness technology for their learning and productivity, to safeguard themselves from the dangers of cyberspace and to learn about maintaining a positive presence in the cyberspace.  

  

Bpians get to discuss and think critically on the contemporary issues such as cyberbullying and the various challenges posed by the social media platforms.  Through the authentic and relatable scenarios shared in class, Bpians express their opinions and learn from the perspectives of others.  These lessons will give Bpians the opportunities to develop the necessary skills to think and make responsible decisions now and in the future.   

  

Through meaningful partnerships, the school also provides BPians with up-to-date and interesting facts about the cyber space.  

  

The school encourages interested students to be cyber wellness ambassadors.  These ambassadors gain deeper knowledge on various cyber wellness issues such as cyber bullying, peer pressure, social media influence and internet addiction. They advocate the importance of cyber wellness and share with their peers their actionable steps to reduce the dangers of the cyberspace.
