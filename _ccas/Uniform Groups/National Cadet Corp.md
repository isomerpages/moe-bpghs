The Bukit Panjang National Cadet Corps (BPNCC) unit is aÂ uniformed group that aims to nurture student cadets to have a Committed Heart, a Resilient Mind and a Fit Body. The unit was awarded Distinction for the 2018 Unit Recognition award after a demanding year of training and courses attended by cadets. This is the pinnacle award an NCC unit can achieve for all-round excellence.  
  
Our cadets attend milestone activities including Camp Forge for Sec 1 cadets, Camp Steel for Secondary Two cadets as well as the Specialists Assessment course for Secondary Three cadets. BPNCC hosts the annual BPNCC Fitness Fiesta where cluster units are invited to participate in various activities to build camaraderie and esprit de corps amongst fellow cadets and Teacher Officers. They also embark on unique programmes such as the SAR21 Live Shoot, cluster training, and take part in the Precision Drills Squad (PDS) and Freestyle Drills Competitions. Our PDS squad even performed during the RSAF50 Open House at Punggol.  
  
Through engaging activities and a culture that instils discipline and fellowship, BPNCC strives to be the premier NCC Land unit in the West district!
