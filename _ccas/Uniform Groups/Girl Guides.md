<p>Bukit Panjang Girl Guides aims to groom all guides to be leaders of character
and grace, who serve selflessly and with humility. Through weekly activities,
the Guides are exposed to valuable skill sets such as organizational, planning,
management and peer mediation skills, in a safe and supportive environment.
Weekly sessions also aim to promote team building and discipline, as well
as encourage critical and flexible thinking.</p>

given the opportunity to build and strengthen their leadership capabilities
by planning and organising events such as the Secondary One Orientation
