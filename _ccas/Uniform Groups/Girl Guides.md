### Girl Guides

![](/images/GG1.jpeg)

Bukit Panjang Girl Guides aims to groom all guides to be leaders of character and grace, who serve selflessly and with humility. Through weekly activities, the Guides are exposed to valuable skill sets such as organizational, planning, management and peer mediation skills. Weekly sessions also aim to promote team building and discipline, as well as encourage critical and flexible thinking.

Guides are also given the opportunity to hone their leadership capabilities by planning programmes such as the Secondary One Orientation Campfire and the annual Girl Guides Camp, as well as host the annual West Division Craft Workshop.

Guides are also equipped with many outdoor survival skills that prepare them to face different scenarios such as tent-pitching, structure-tying, outdoor cooking and gadget-making.  Our Guides also participate in obstacle courses, foot drills and physical training as part of our programme to build their resilience. Guides can sign up for various courses and enrichment programmes organised by Guides HQ. Enrichment activities which focus on 21st century core skills and competencies are also included in the guides programme to provide them with a more holistic education.

In 2018, seven BP Girl Guides had the opportunity to represent Singapore at two International Camps - one at Penang, and the other at the United Kingdom. At these camps, the students interacted with Girl Guides and Girl Scouts from other countries, developed life skills and learnt more about themselves. 

The Guides have done the school proud in several competitions at the annual West Division Day. The company has also clinched its 12th consecutive Gold Puan Noor Aishah (PNA) Award for Excellence. In addition, three of the school’s Girl Guides, Sylvia Ong Hui Juan (402), Phang Jia Hui (403) and Tay Jeslyn (404A) were awarded the Baden-Powell Award, the highest award given out by the Chief Commissioner to a Guide.

Through the various challenges posed by the rigorous Guides programme, our company has grown to be more confident and united. Together, we aspire to greater heights!
