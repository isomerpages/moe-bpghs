The St John Brigade was founded not just with the primary aim to equip members with the necessary skills to save lives, but to develop them into resourceful, skilful and confident individuals.  
  
Triage assessments are often conducted to expose our members to real-life emergencies. Training sessions focus on four main domains: First Aid, Home Nursing, Transportation of Casualty (TOC) and Foot drill.  
  
SJB cadets are also sent to various courses under the different groupings recommended in the Cadet Proficiency Badge scheme to encourage them to further develop their interest in subjects covered beyond their normal curriculum. They also learn to develop a strong sense of social awareness by participating in fund-raising activities such as Flag Days and Walkathons. We believe that such meaningful CCA experiences contribute to the quality of school experience for these future leaders.
