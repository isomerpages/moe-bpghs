### Scouts

![](/images/scouts1.jpeg)

Started in 1958, BP Eagle Scout Group has a long history of tradition, values and achievements. The aim of the Bukit Panjang Eagle Scout Group is to educate young people to become competent individuals who play a constructive role in society. The group comprises a Scout Troop and a Venture Scout Unit.

  

To instill in members a love for the outdoors and to inculcate team spirit, leadership, compassion and a sense of responsibility, BP Eagle Scouts organises activities such as camping, orienteering, foot drills, outdoor cooking, pioneering, campfires and Values-In-Action programmes. In addition, the scouts have the opportunities to work with the Girl Guides in the planning and preparation of the Secondary One Orientation Campfires, and interact with scouts from overseas squads through events like Jamborees and Overseas Exchange Programmes.
