‘Discipline and Teamwork’ is the motto of the Bukit Panjang Government High School (BPGHS) Basketball Team. The CCA provides a platform for players to discover their strengths, weaknesses and leadership qualities by being a part of this exclusive team. Every team member ardently encourages his peers to train hard, train well, focus and to do his utmost for the team, with or without the ball in possession.

  

Players train on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays during the school term and with added intensity during school holidays and competition periods. This ensures that the gentlemen are well-prepared for the West Zone Inter-School Basketball Competition and Nationals once qualification is secured. The team also participates in other competitions and friendly games throughout the year against quality opponents from international schools.

  

The team will continue to strive for excellence and uphold the good name of the school. The journey together is amplified by the team’s belief: **“It doesn’t matter who scores the most or gets the most rebounds, as long as we do it together.”**
