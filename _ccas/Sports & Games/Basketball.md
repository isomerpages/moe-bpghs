<h1>Basketball (Boys)</h1>
<p>The Basketball (Boys) CCA seeks to develop student-athletes who exemplify
grit, teamwork, and sportsmanship both on and off the court. Guided by
our mission to nurture basketballers with a champion mindset, we believe
that every training session and competition is an opportunity to build
character, discipline, and resilience.</p>
<p><strong>Signature Programmes and Developmental Platforms</strong>
<br>Beyond training, our basketballers grow through a range of distinctive
programmes designed to develop character, leadership, and 21st Century
Competencies. These experiences enable our players to learn, interact,
and bond with peers from diverse backgrounds — deepening their friendships,
sense of belonging, and commitment to the team.</p>
<p><strong>1. Structured and Holistic Training Programme</strong>
<br>Our structured training programme focuses on the holistic development
of our players — refining technical skills, enhancing tactical understanding,
building athletic conditioning, and strengthening psychological resilience.</p>
<p>In 2025, we enhanced our training through the inaugural Sports Nutrition
and Fitness Workshops, led by certified personal trainers. During these
sessions, student-athletes learned about evidence-based strength training,
recovery techniques, and the importance of a balanced diet in optimising
athletic performance. This emphasis on knowledge and application empowers
our players to take ownership of their development, both as athletes and
individuals.</p>

<p><strong>2. Inter-school Games</strong>
<br>Participation in the National School Games (NSG), other inter-school tournaments,
and friendly matches provide our basketballers with authentic platforms
to put their skills and values into action.
<br>These experiences build resilience, teamwork, and humility, as our players
learn to handle both victory and defeat with grace.</p>
