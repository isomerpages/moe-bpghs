Fencing, also known as the art of swordsmanship, not only challenges one’s opponent in an intense fight between two individuals but also aims to push the boundaries of one’s own limits. It helps develop quick thinking, poise, body coordination, agility and speed, all of which are beneficial to growing teenagers. The BPGHS Fencing team is dedicated to fulfill all these aims as well as inculcate valuable life skills and traits such as leadership, team spirit, focus, determination and discipline in every student member.

  

First formed in January 2000, the BPGHS Fencing family has since grown in numbers and there have been many commendable achievements in national competitions as well as international platforms.
