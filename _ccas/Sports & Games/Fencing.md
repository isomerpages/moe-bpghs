<p>Fencing, also known as the art of swordsmanship, aims to encourage one
to push the boundaries of one’s limits. It helps develop quick thinking,
poise, body coordination, agility and speed. BPGHS Fencing Team is dedicated
to fulfill all these aims. The team also inculcates valuable life skills
and traits such as leadership, team spirit, focus, determination and discipline
in every student member.</p>
<p>First formed in January 2000, the BPGHS Fencing family has since grown
in number. Our fencers train hard to hone their skills. To gain more experience,
they participate in various competitions. Our fencers show determination
and put-up commendable performance, building their confidence and resilience.</p>
<p>In recent years, our fencing team has truly shone at the National Schools
Games (NSG). More fencers from both B and C Divisions reaching the top
32 are a testament to their focus and discipline.</p>
<p>In 2024, the team secured 4th place in the C Division Girls’ Team Championship.
Goh Xin Ze clinched 3rd place in the C Division Girls’ Epee Individual
event, marking a significant milestone in our school’s fencing history.</p>

in an international tournaments where they faced off against top regional
talents. These experiences sharpened their skills and broadened their perspective
on sport.</p>

school, contributing to key events such as the Co-Curricular Activities
