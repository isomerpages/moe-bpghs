<p>Floorball at BPGHS is an energetic and dynamic team sport that brings
out the best in every player. The fast paced nature of the game keeps our
players constantly on their toes, building agility, coordination, and quick
decision making skills. Every training session challenges our students
to think strategically, move decisively, and play as one cohesive team.</p>
<p>Beyond the court, our boys forge strong bonds through shared goals and
teamwork. They learn the value of resilience, discipline, and sportsmanship,
which are qualities that extend far beyond the game.</p>
<p>Our C Division boys achieved an impressive 4th place finish in the National
School Games League 2 in 2024, a testament to their hard work and dedication.
The team also regularly participates in external competitions to gain experience,
challenge themselves, and continually improve their game.</p>
<p>Our Floorball team strives for excellence in competition while nurturing
confidence, camaraderie, and character in every player.</p>
