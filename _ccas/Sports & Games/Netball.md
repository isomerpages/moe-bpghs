<p>The Bukit Panjang Netball Team aims to nurture every player’s talent and
leadership potential in the sport and develop in them values of teamwork,
camaraderie, responsibility, and resilience.</p>
<p>In 2018, the ‘B’ and ‘C’ Divisions did the school proud by attaining the
third and fourth placing respectively in the West Zone Inter-Schools Competition.</p>
<p>As a firm believer of experiential learning, BP Netball participates in
various netball carnival events held annually, such as the Netops Netball
Carnival, Sneakers, and Daisy Tan Netball Carnival. In 2018, the netball
team also participated in an overseas immersion trip to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia,
to gain exposure to other skills and techniques which proved to be a rich
learning experience for them.</p>
