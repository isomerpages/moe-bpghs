Through the years, the BP Volleyball boys’ and girls’ teams have consistently attained the top four placings in both the National and Zonal inter-school competitions, establishing themselves as one of the top volleyball teams in Singapore.

  

The BP volleyball team is a closely knit family that values teamwork, discipline and humility.  Every member of the team understands that it is never about being the best in the team but always about doing their best for the team. 

The team believes in working hard together and that the team as a whole is greater than the sum of its parts. By always putting in maximum effort coupled with the right attitude, every member of the volleyball team aims to be an exemplary student-athlete who does the school proud both on and off the court.

  

There are 4 divisions comprising nearly 100 players altogether. Training sessions are held 3 times a week throughout the year in preparation for various competitions, such as the yearly West Zone and Nationals Inter-school tournaments, the Under-16 and Under-14 National Competitions organized by the Volleyball Association of Singapore. There are also plans to venture overseas for international competitions and training exchange programmes, so as to expose our players to new volleyball techniques and skills.

  

Many of our players have also been selected to represent the Singapore Combined Schools in local and regional competitions such as the Asean Schools Games and have been awarded the Zonal/ National Colours Awards which helped them gain admission to the tertiary institution of their choice. Every volleyball player is a proud member of the team and many graduate from the school with a deep sense of achievement and enjoyment that is truly unique to this sport.
