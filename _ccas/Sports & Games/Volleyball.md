<p>The BP Volleyball teams have long upheld the school’s proud tradition
of excellence in the sport. Our boys’ and girls’ teams consistently achieve
top placings in the National School Games (NSG) at both the West Zone and
National levels, earning recognition as one of the leading volleyball schools
in Singapore.</p>
<p>Beyond their achievements, the teams place strong emphasis on teamwork,
discipline, and character. Every member learns to think critically in challenging
situations, care for their teammates, and serve with humility and dedication.
These shared values guide them to grow not just as athletes, but as individuals
who demonstrate responsibility, resilience, and respect both on and off
the court.</p>
<p>With nearly 100 members across four divisions, the teams train consistently
throughout the year in preparation for major tournaments such as the National
School Games, as well as the Under-16 and Under-14 National Championships
organised by the Volleyball Association of Singapore. Players also gain
valuable experience through friendly matches with other schools, which
provide opportunities to strengthen teamwork and refine their gameplay.</p>
<p>For every BP volleyballer, the journey is about striving for excellence
together — learning, growing, and playing with heart.</p>
