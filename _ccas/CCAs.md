<h3>CCAs</h3>
<p>To access a list of CCAs, click on the relevant tabs on the left-hand
side of the page or the menu tab at the top of the page (mobile version).*</p>
<p>The CCA programme plays a significant role in the holistic development
of our students. CCAs inculcate sound moral values, build character, foster
camaraderie and deepen studentsâ€™ sense of belonging and sense of responsibility
to school, community and nation. Through the CCA experience, students are
equipped with 21st&nbsp;century competencies to better prepare them for
their future work and life.</p>
<p>The guiding principles for the CCA programme are as follows:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>to build character, team spirit and responsibility,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to be broad-based with opportunities to specialise,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to inculcate national values, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to promote social integration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
