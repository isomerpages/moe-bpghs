The CCA programme plays a significant role in the holistic development of our students. CCAs inculcate sound moral values, build character, foster camaraderie and deepen students’ sense of belonging and sense of responsibility to school, community and nation. Through the CCA experience, students are equipped with 21st century competencies to better prepare them for their future work and life.

  

The guiding principles for the CCA programme are as follows:

*   to inculcate national values, and
*   to promote social integration.
