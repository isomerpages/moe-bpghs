<p>BP Communication Link promotes the mass enjoyment of quality sound and
lighting effects across numerous school events through the provision of
audio and lighting support. The club also ensures the smooth execution
of daily morning assemblies in the courtyard and in the hall.</p>
<p>Members of the club get to learn how to operate a variety of Public Address
(PA) systems across various school premises. Students also pick up valuable
skills from their seniors and trainers on how to operate different types
of equipment such as microphones, CD players and mixers. The club also
hones the students’ sense of responsibility, and initiative as they dedicate
their services to the school.</p>
<p>In addition, members of the club gain exposure to operating equipment
commonly used in other industries through structured learning journeys.
This also allows them to explore related career paths in the PA industry.</p>
