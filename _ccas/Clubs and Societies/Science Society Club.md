<p><strong><u>Exploring Frontiers of Science and Technology: The Science Team’s 2025 Journey</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Science Team at our school continues to be a dynamic co-curricular
activity that unites two exciting units: Astronomy and Robotics. Together,
they provide students with the opportunity to explore their curiosity,
develop scientific thinking, and collaborate in a supportive and stimulating
environment. Through hands-on activities, competitions, and peer learning,
the Science Team empowers students to innovate, problem-solve, and think
critically—qualities essential for the scientists and engineers of tomorrow.</p>
<p>The Astronomy Unit invites members to embark on a journey through the
cosmos. Through peer sharing, interactive games, and observational sessions,
students deepen their understanding of celestial phenomena and master practical
skills such as telescope handling. Members also challenge themselves by
taking part in national competitions like the HCI-RI Astrigue Challenge
and the NUS-NTU AstroChallenge, building both knowledge and confidence.</p>
<p>The camaraderie among members fosters a vibrant community of learners
passionate about unraveling the mysteries of the universe. The Robotics
Unit, guided by a dedicated coach, offers members a hands-on platform to
design, build, and programme robots for various challenges. Beyond technical
skills, these sessions cultivate resilience, creativity, and teamwork—skills
that extend far beyond the robotics lab.</p>
<p>2025 has been an eventful and rewarding year for the Robotics Unit. In
April, five teams comprising 19 students participated in the RoboCup Singapore
Open 2025. Among them, one team of four students earned a Merit in the
RoboCup Junior Soccer category, while another team of four students achieved
a Merit in the RCAP Rescue Line competition. Beyond competitions, members
also had the enriching opportunity to attend a two-day non-residential
SMART Camp on the Computer Vision Robotic Hand Programme at the Science
Centre Singapore. This hands-on experience deepened students’ appreciation
of artificial intelligence and robotics applications in real-world contexts.</p>
<p>The Science Team’s achievements this year reflect not only technical excellence
but also curiosity, collaboration, and a shared passion for discovery.
Both the Astronomy and Robotics Units continue to inspire and nurture young
innovators, ensuring that our school remains a hub of scientific creativity
and exploration. The Science Team stands as a testament to what students
can achieve when they are encouraged to dream, explore, and invent.</p>
