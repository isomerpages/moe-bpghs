By providing a platform for students to actively participate in Values in Action (ViA) within the community, the Service Learning Club (SLC) aims to cultivate a sense of volunteerism in students, enabling the students to reach out to various communities in need.

  

A number of whole-school activities are organised every year by the SLC members, including the school’s annual Operation Orange during the eve of Chinese New Year , when students collaborate with their fellow schoolmates to show appreciation to the residents by giving out oranges at their residence. The club members are also in charge of the annual ‘Keep The School Clean’ movement, to garner the support of the whole school to clean up the school before everyone leaves for the holidays.

  

We also collaborate closely with Keat Hong Community Centre, where students are given the opportunities to be involved in various community centre activities, some of which include the annual Halloween programme, Go Green and Edusave Merit Bursary Award Ceremonies. These activities enable students to develop a sense of responsibility and strengthen ties with nearby residents.

  

Some of our outstanding student leaders who are passionate and proactive in giving back to society have won many prestigious awards over the past few years, which include the 2018 PAYM Project Accolade Bronze and Silver Awards.

  

We hope that through the efforts of these students, other fellow BPians will be inspired to do their part for the community by embarking on more VIA projects and initiatives to benefit the community and society.
