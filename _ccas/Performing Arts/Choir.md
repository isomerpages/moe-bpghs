<h1>Choir</h1>
<p>Bukit Panjang Government High School Choir, which was founded in 1994,
comprises students who have a passion to sing and further develop their
choral abilities.
<br>The choir has evolved over the years from a two-part ensemble to a full-fledged
STAB (Soprano, Alto, Tenor and Bass) choir. Our repertoire includes folk
songs from various countries sung in their original languages and songs
from musicals.
<br>The choir believes that music is truly a universal language that speaks
to the soul and enriches the mind. Through choral singing, we seek to nurture
values that develop the whole child – values like discipline, teamwork
and aesthetic sensitivity.</p>
