<p><strong>About us:</strong>
<br>The Bukit Panjang Concert Band has had a long and distinguished history.
Beginning as a combined band with Teck Whye Secondary School, we struck
out on our own in 2003 and have since established ourselves as one of the
prominent school bands in Singapore. We have developed a unique identity
over the years. Taking part in both the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF)
Arts Presentation for marching and concert bands, we have consistently
achieved the Certificate of Distinction and Certificate of Accomplishment
for marching and concert bands respectively. Beyond musical excellence,
the band continues to nurture values that define who we are — perseverance
in the face of challenge, discipline in practice, and dedication to one
another. Every rehearsal, performance, and competition becomes a lesson
in teamwork, humility, and resilience. These values not only shape us into
better musicians, but also into individuals who strive for excellence in
all aspects of life.</p>

<p><strong>Our Band Experience:</strong>
<br>To hone our musical skills, we engage the help of prominent clinicians
to conduct masterclasses and participate in exchange programmes with other
school bands in Singapore. As one of the biggest CCAs in school, we have
many members who treat band as our second family. Every band member is
important and we take a lot of effort in ensuring the well-being of one
another. Apart from band practices, we regularly organise bonding activities
such as camps and games. Our band programme helps cultivate a strong sense
of camaraderie and ensures that we maintain a high standard of musicality.</p>
