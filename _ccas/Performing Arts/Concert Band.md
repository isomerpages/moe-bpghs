<p><strong><u>About us:</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Bukit Panjang Military Band has had a long and distinguished history.
Beginning as a combined band with Teck Whye Secondary School, we struck
out on our own in 2003 and have since established ourselves as one of the
prominent school marching bands in Singapore. We have developed a unique
identity over the years. Taking part in both the Singapore Youth Festival
(SYF) Arts Presentation for marching and concert bands, we have consistently
achieved the Certificate of Distinction and Certificate of Accomplishment
for marching and concert bands respectively. Our motto, ‘Ever Forceful,
Ever Graceful’, conveys our desire to be versatile in our craft and expresses
the values that we treasure in the band — perseverance, discipline and
dedication. These values resonate in each band member and pushes us to
achieve greater heights of excellence.</p>
<p><strong><u>BPMB experience:</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Our members get a full range of experience taking part in both SYF Arts
Presentation for marching and concert bands. To hone our musical skills,
we engage the help of prominent clinicians to conduct masterclasses and
participate in exchange programmes with other school bands in Singapore.
As one of the biggest CCAs in school, we have many members who treat band
as our second family. Every band member is important and we take a lot
of effort in ensuring the well-being of one another. Apart from band practices,
we regularly organise bonding activities such as camps and games. Our band
programme helps cultivate a strong sense of camaraderie and ensures that
we maintain a high standard of musicality.</p>
