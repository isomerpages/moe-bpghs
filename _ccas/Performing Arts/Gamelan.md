<p>BPGHS is one of the very few secondary schools in Singapore that offers
Gamelan Ensemble as a Co-Curricular Activity (CCA).</p>
<p><strong>CCA day and time:</strong>
<br>Wednesdays, 4.00pm to 6.00pm. Additional days (when necessary): Mondays/Fridays/
Saturdays.</p>
<p><strong>Our history:</strong>
<br>The ensemble was first set up in 2003 as a niche activity for students
offering the Elective Malay for Secondary Schools (EMAS) Programme. Later,
the ensemble opened to all students as one of the school’s CCA groups.
In 2005, the ensemble participated in its first Singapore Youth Festival
(SYF) Arts Presentation as a CCA group.</p>
<p><strong>Gamelan instruments:</strong>
<br>Gamelan instruments may be tuned to the scale of slendro (in which the
octave is divided into five tones roughly equidistant) or to pelog (a scale
consisting of seven notes of varying intervals of which five are given
principal stress). At present, BPGHS Gamelan ensemble uses the set of instruments
tuned to the slendro scale.</p>
<p>The notes of the slendro scale can be designated in different ways; one
common way is the use of numbers often called by their names in Javanese,
especially in a shortened form. There is no 4 in the slendro scale.</p>
<p><strong>Our instructor:</strong>
<br>Mr Amran Ahmad has been the person responsible teaching and guiding the
members since the ensemble was first set up in 2003. Mr Amran is a qualified
engineer who fell in love with Gamelan music while working in Indonesia
many years back. His deep passion for Gamelan music motivated him to attend
numerous courses and workshops conducted by established artistic organisations
in Indonesia. At present, Mr Amran is active in conducting Gamelan music
programmes in educational institutions. He is also an active member of
a Gamelan performing group that performs in local events and outside Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>Our activities:</strong>
<br>The ensemble participates in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentations,
which is organised by the CCA Branch, MOE, biannually. The ensemble also
performed in outreach activities organised by the MOE, Community Clubs
and other organisations.</p>
