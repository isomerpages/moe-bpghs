<p>The BP International Dance (Chinese Dance) CCA is a vibrant group of 43
passionate dancers who express their love for the art through graceful
and dynamic performances. Throughout the year, they showcase their talents
at school events such as the Chinese New Year Concert, National Day, and
Teachers’ Day celebrations. In 2025, the team attained a Certificate of
Distinction at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation (Chinese
Dance). With every performance, our dancers exude elegance, poise, and
confidence, captivating audiences with their artistry and spirit.</p>
