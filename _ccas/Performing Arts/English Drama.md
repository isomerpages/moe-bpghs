<strong>Our Purpose</strong>
<br>The English Drama Club was established in 2011 to develop passionate drama members in stagecraft as well as vocal and physical expression.

Drama members work together as a team to manipulate the dramatic elements effectively for stage performances.

We believe that every single person in both the cast and the crew, plays a vital role towards a successful production.

* **Learning Journeys** for members to appreciate and learn from a        variety of theatre performances of different styles.
