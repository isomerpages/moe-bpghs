<p>The English Drama Club was established in 2011 to develop passionate drama
members in stagecraft as well as vocal and physical expression.</p>
<p>Drama members work together as a team to manipulate the dramatic elements
effectively for stage performances. We believe that every single member
in both the cast and the crew plays a vital role towards a successful production
and our learning as a budding theatre club.</p>
