<p><strong>Our Purpose</strong>
<br>The English Drama Club was established in 2011 to develop passionate drama
members in stagecraft as well as vocal and physical expression.</p>
<p>Drama members work together as a team to manipulate the dramatic elements
effectively for stage performances.</p>
<p>We believe that every single person in both the cast and the crew, plays
a vital role towards a successful production.</p>
