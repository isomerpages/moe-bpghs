From a mere 8 members in 1999 to 45 dancers today, Bukit Panjang Government High International Dance as a CCA has been gaining momentum in terms of skills and exposure. The CCA seeks to nurture and develop the talent and passion for dancing in aspiring students, particularly in the following objectives:

*   To promote a high level of physical fitness & skill competency in all the dancers
*   To nurture and develop responsible dancers and leaders
*   To instill team work amongst dancers
*   To learn to appreciate dance as an art form

  

Under the guidance of experienced instructors and teachers, our dancers develop competence in modern and contemporary Chinese dance forms. BPGHS Dance provides them with opportunities to showcase their talents through various platforms which include

*   External competitions
*   Public performance
*   In-house performance
*   Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation

Some of the events our dancers were involved in include SHOWCASE! Performing Arts Festival, organized by CCAB and the pre-show segment of Ballet under the Stars organized by the Singapore Dance Theatre.
