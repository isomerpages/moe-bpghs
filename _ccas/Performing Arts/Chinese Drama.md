The Chinese Drama Club was established in 2011 with the objective of using theatre arts as a medium for student to increase their mastery and interest in the Chinese Language.

  

The club consists of students who are passionate about acting and interested to explore self-expression through the Chinese Language. With a heightened awareness and skill set related to theatre performances, the students would also develop a keener sense of aesthetic appreciation.

The Chinese Drama Club actively supports school events by performing at performances and celebrations such as Chinese New Year, 2018 school cultural performance - "Legend of the White Snake" and Mid-Autumn Festival.

  

The club also regularly organises outings to plays and performances to expose students to different forms of drama art and foster closer bonds between members.
