<p>Bukit Panjang Government High School’s National Police Cadet Corps (BPNPCC)
offers cadets a distinguished journey of learning, leadership, and service.
Through purposeful training and immersive experiences, cadets cultivate
confidence, discipline, and integrity, developing the skills and character
essential for personal growth and responsible citizenship.</p>
<p>Throughout the year, cadets refine their abilities in foot drills and
campcraft, strengthening precision, resilience, and teamwork. Complementing
these foundational skills are programmes that deepen their understanding
of law enforcement, civic responsibility, and the values of empathy, integrity,
and social awareness.</p>

<p>Cadets gain practical exposure to policing through visits to the Neighbourhood
Police Centre and the Police Procedures Course, learning about the roles
of police officers and emergency management protocols. They develop resilience
and teamwork through the Adventure Training Camp at Pulau Ubin and strengthen
self-defence skills via the Unarmed Tactics Course, a programme covering
stances, shuffles, blocks, and stuns.</p>
<p>Cadets also pursue the Civil Defence Badge under the SCDF Responders Plus
Programme and attend the Basic Law Course, which explores criminal law,
the role of law and enforcement in maintaining a peaceful and stable society,
elements of crime, and common offences. Anti-Narcotics Course, conducted
in collaboration with the Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association (SANA),
cultivates awareness of drug abuse and reinforces responsible decision-making.</p>

<p>Further enhancing their skills, cadets participate in the .22 Revolver
Live Shoot Programme, mastering marksmanship principles, safe handling,
and immediate action drills, and the Enhanced Crime Scene Investigation
(CSI) Course, which provides hands-on experience in mock-up HDB flats and
Virtual Reality On-Scene Investigations at the Home Team Academy, allowing
cadets to apply investigative and crime scene management skills in realistic
scenarios.</p>
<p>As a cohesive unit, cadets engage in the Unit Camp, bonding activities,
and the school’s National Day Parade, fostering camaraderie, pride, and
esprit de corps. They also represent the unit in Area Games Day, Inter-Unit
CSI or Campcraft Competitions, and the prestigious National Police Annual
Parade (NPAP).</p>
