<p>Started in 1958, BP Eagle Scout Group has a long history of tradition,
values and achievements. The aim of the Bukit Panjang Eagle Scout Group
is to educate young people to become competent individuals who play a constructive
role in society. The group comprises a Scout Troop and a Venture Scout
Unit.</p>
<p>To instill in members a love for the outdoors and to inculcate team spirit,
leadership, compassion and a sense of responsibility, BP Eagle Scouts organises
activities such as camping, orienteering, foot drills, outdoor cooking,
pioneering, campfires and Values-In-Action programmes. In addition, the
scouts have the opportunities to work with the Girl Guides in the planning
and preparation of the Secondary One Orientation Campfires, and interact
with scouts from overseas squads through events like Jamborees and Overseas
Exchange Programmes.</p>
