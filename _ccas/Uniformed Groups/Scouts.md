<p>The BP Eagle Scouts organise a wide range of activities such as foot drills,
hikes, knot-tying and lashing for gadget-making, cooking, and campfires.
Through foot drills for parades and National Observance ceremonies, scouts
develop discipline and resilience as they strive to improve their standards.
Knot-tying and lashing encourage creativity and inventiveness as scouts
design and build their own structures. During cooking sessions, they learn
to plan, prepare, and cook their own dishes.</p>
<p>Each year, our scouts co-organise the Secondary One Orientation Campfire
with the Girl Guides. This provides opportunities to collaborate across
various departments in planning, rehearsing, and executing the event. Along
the way, scouts learn adaptability and resourcefulness as they find solutions
to challenges. Through close interaction with the Guides, they sharpen
their communication, collaboration, and information skills, while also
applying technology to record rehearsals and play music. In addition, we
actively participate in external campfires.</p>
<p>Our scouts also volunteer with the Keat Hong Community Club, giving them
valuable opportunities to interact with and serve members of the community.</p>
<p>Beyond Singapore, our scouts engage with overseas units through events
such as Jamborees, Jamboree-On-The-Air, and Jamboree-On-The-Internet, where
they connect and exchange experiences with scouts from around the world.</p>
<p>Through these diverse experiences, we provide scouts with a strong platform
to grow into confident, self-directed learners who are equipped with life
skills and a heart for the community.</p>
