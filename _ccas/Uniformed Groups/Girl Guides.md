<p>Bukit Panjang Girl Guides aims to groom all guides to be leaders of character
and grace, who serve selflessly and with humility. Through weekly activities,
the Guides are exposed to valuable skill sets such as organizational, planning,
management and peer mediation skills, in a safe and supportive environment.
Weekly sessions also aim to promote team building and discipline, as well
as encourage critical and flexible thinking.</p>

<p>On top of taking the lead in Unit and Patrol activities, Guides are also
given the opportunity to build and strengthen their leadership capabilities
by planning and organising events such as the Secondary One Orientation
Campfire, annual Girl Guides Camp and West Division Learning Day.</p>

<p>Guiding also creates opportunities for girls to understand current complex
issues confronting the world today – such as cyber safety, body confidence
and environmental sustainability. Guides are also equipped with outdoor
survival skills such as outdoor cooking and gadget-making. HQ-organised
activities and competitions equips girls with skills to take action by
leading and by participating in service projects, they are able to give
back and make an impact on the community.</p>

well in the test are awarded the Baden-Powell Award, the highest award
given out by the Chief Commissioner to a Guide.</p>

our company has grown to be more confident and united. Together, we aspire
to greater heights!</p>
