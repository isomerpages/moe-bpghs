<p>The St. John Brigade (SJB) is a uniformed group dedicated to serving the
school and community by providing first aid and care whenever it is most
needed. Guided by our motto, “For the Service of Mankind,” SJB nurtures
caring and resourceful first aiders who serve with confidence, discipline,
and compassion.</p>
<p>Our training focuses on four key domains — First Aid, Home Nursing, Transportation
of Casualty (TOC), and Foot Drill — to build both competence and character.
Cadets undergo triage assessments and simulated emergency scenarios to
apply their knowledge in realistic situations with teamwork and confidence.

<p>Beyond first aid, our members play an active role in health advocacy.
SJB collaborated with the Health Promotion Board (HPB) as Health Ambassadors,
designing and leading interactive games and activities to raise awareness
about the dangers of smoking and vaping and to promote healthy eating among
teenagers.</p>
<p>Proudly serving under the Northwest District, our cadets develop essential
skills in leadership, communication, discipline, and emergency response,
growing into confident individuals ready to serve and make a difference.</p>
