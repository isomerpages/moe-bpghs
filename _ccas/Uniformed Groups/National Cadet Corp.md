<p>The Bukit Panjang National Cadet Corps (BPNCC) unit is a&nbsp;uniformed
group that aims to nurture student cadets to have a Committed Heart, a
Resilient Mind and a Fit Body.</p>
<p>At the start of the year, both the Precision Drills Squad and the Free
Style Drills teams performed in the CCA Roadshow. On 8th February, BPGHS
hosted and participated in the PDS competition for the West Zone. We also
hosted the competition for the Central Zone in the afternoon. All the BPGHS
cadets were activated to help in administration and logistics for both
sessions. On 22nd February, BPGHS participated in the FSD competition for
the West Zone. During the June holidays, we had our annual camp where we
had activities like Laser Tech, Hike at Coney Island and Forest Adventure.
The Cadets also went through a series of Camps and Assessment, namely Camp
Forge for Sec 1, Camp Steel for Sec 2 and Specialist Assessment for Sec
3. Ten Cadet Leaders were also chosen to attend the Senior Specialist Leadership
Course.</p>

<p>In Semester 2, on 8th July, we commemorated NCC Day where we presented
the Distinction Award to our Principal, Mr Seet and MSG Dylon Ng received
the Outstanding Cadet Award. Also in this semester, six of our cadets represented
BPNCC for an air rifle competition in the West Zone in which we emerged
runner-up. We organised the Inter-UG soccer competition for the 4th consecutive
year. We also participated in the District Sports Championship for Captain’s
Ball, Frisbee and Soccer. Our Soccer Team emerged first in the Grouping
and will proceed to the National Final Round. On National Day, we had a
combined UG contingent forming up the Guard of Honour. The NCC also showcased
the PDS and FSD performance after the parade. On 19 August, four of our
Senior Cadets participated in the Orienteering Competition, of which they
obtained full marks.</p>
