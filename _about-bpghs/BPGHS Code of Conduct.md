# Student Management

In Bukit Panjang Government High School, we believe that every child can engage in behaviours that enable him/her to learn and develop.

Students learn best in a supportive environment. We endeavour to continue to build a safe, respectful and caring community that promotes and supports positive student behaviours and discipline, so that teaching and learning opportunities are maximised and students are motivated to put forth their best in their pursuits.

With this philosophy, we are committed to support students with timely corrective guidance to address their misbehaviour, which may deter them from learning effectively.
