<p><strong>Inspiring Teacher of English Award (ITEA)</strong><br/>The ITEA recognises teachers who ignite a passion for the English language, and are effective in helping their students speak and write better. These teachers are passionate about making English interesting and relevant, and are innovative in engaging their students in the language learning process.&nbsp;<br /><br />We are proud to announce that&nbsp;<strong>Mr Brian Lim</strong>&nbsp;is one of only four educators who have been awarded the 2021 ITEA - Teaching Award. Mr Lim believes that English is not just a subject in school or another exam to pass, but something that will impact their lives. He promotes thinking and the use of language through engaging discussions in class.
