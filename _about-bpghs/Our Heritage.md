<h2><u>Our Heritage</u></h2>

Bukit Panjang Government High School was formed on 11 January 1960, with the merging of Bukit Panjang Secondary School and Chua Chu Kang Government Chinese Middle School into one single school building at Jalan Teck Whye. It was the first 'integrated' government school in Singapore, integrating the Chinese and English streams of education.

In 1993, the school moved from its old premises at Jalan Teck Whye to its present site at Choa Chu Kang. Over the years, the school continued to make great strides in the academic field as well as in other non-academic endeavours, and has won many awards which affirmed the good work and efforts of both our teachers and students.

The **Circle** symbolises integration and perfection.
<br>The **Red Triangle** stands for brotherhood and the common bond among all BPians.
<br>The **Three Points** of the Triangle represent freedom, equality and benevolence, which stand as beacons in our lives.
<br>The **Green Background** represents the green countryside of our district which reminds us of our humble rural beginnings.
<br>The **Book**, which contains our Motto, signifies the BPians' educational journey.

The **Three symbols** stand for different aspects of our educational programme:
<br>The Atom        -    laying a strong foundation in cognitive and character development
<br>The Ship          -    imbuing a spirit of discovery and lifelong learning
<br>The Hurdler    -    building a robust body and mind ready to take on life's challenges
