<h1>FAQ</h1>
<h3>General Information</h3>
<p><strong>1. What is the indicative score range of BPGHS based on the 2023 cohort?</strong>
<br><strong>Ans:</strong>
<br>Posting Group 3: 7-11
<br>Posting Group 2: 21-22
<br>Posting Group 1: 25-26</p>
<p><strong>2. Should I select BPGHS as one of my choices if I just met the minimum requirements of the indicative score range?</strong>
<br><strong>Ans:</strong>&nbsp;The indicative score range is calculated based
on the range of PSLE score of the 2023 cohort. It should be noted that
the&nbsp;Cut Off Point (COP) varies from year to year. One way to go about
choosing a school would be to list down schools that you are keen to join
and check whether their COP is near your PSLE score. You can then put these
schools down in your application in descending order of their COP. That
should put you in a good position to get into a school that you are keen
to join.</p>
<p><strong>3. My child qualified for Posting Group 3, can he/she apply for Posting Group 2 in BPGHS?</strong>
<br><strong>Ans:</strong>&nbsp;Your child will not be able to apply to join
