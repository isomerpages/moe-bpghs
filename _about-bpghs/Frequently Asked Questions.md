non-weighted assessments, such as project work and presentations.</p>

devices will be done in school. A separate briefing will be conducted later.</p>

<p><strong>14.&nbsp; If a student is enrolled into BPGHS via DSA Malay, what activities will he/she be expected to participate in? Must he/she join the Malay Cultural Society CCA and take Malay Literature subject for his/her O Level? </strong>
<br><strong>Answer:</strong> If a student enters our school via DSA Malay,
he/she will take Higher Malay Language (HML) as a subject and be part of
a comprehensive Elective Programme for Malay Language in Secondary Schools
(EMAS), just like other Express students taking HML in our school.</p>
<p>In addition, the school will be preparing the DSA Malay students for the
Malay Language Elective Programme (MLEP). The programme aims to nurture
promising students to attain a high level of language proficiency in Malay,
enhance their understanding of Malay literature and develop academically-able
students to become effectively bilingual so as to better serve the needs
of our nation. The 2-year programme (Secondary 3 and 4) is for students
who study ‘O’ Level Literature in Malay, in either full or elective. MLEP
activities include language and cultural camps, overseas immersion trips,
language symposiums and enrichment workshops on creative writing, drama
script writing, public speaking, translation and journalism.</p>
<p><strong>15.&nbsp; Does BPGHS have an Applied Learning Programme (ALP)? </strong>
<br><strong>Answer:</strong> BPGHS is an autonomous school, and thus we do
not offer ALP. However, all our students participate in our in-house Interdisciplinary
Project Work (IPW), which equips students with interdisciplinary problem-solving
skills and hones their collaborative and communication skills.</p>

<br>3. Performing Arts</p>

<h4>DISCIPLINE</h4>
<p><strong>20.&nbsp; What is the policy of the school on Personal Electronic Device (PED) usage in school?</strong>
<br><strong>Answer:</strong> Students are not encouraged to bring their PEDs
to school. If they choose to do so, they are personally responsible and
accountable for the safe-keeping of their PEDs, to prevent loss, damage
or theft.</p>
<p>Students are not allowed to wear smart watches to school to prevent distraction
during lessons. The school is a place set apart for conducive learning
to take place. Students should respect the place provided by upholding
the rules and guidelines that allow each and every student to learn effectively.</p>
