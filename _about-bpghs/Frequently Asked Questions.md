<p><strong>2. If I was not posted to BPGHS and wish to appeal into the school, how do I do so? </strong>
<br><strong>Answer:</strong> Firstly, your PSLE score will have to meet the
COP for BPGHS for that posting group for the year. Secondly, there is a
link in our Sec 1 Registration and Appeal website where there is a link
for Appeals to be filled up. The school will get back to you if there are
successful appeal applicants.</p>

Sec 1-3 students will have 1 weighted assessment in each term for Term
1-3, and an End- of-Year Examination in Term 4. Sec 4 and 5 students will
sit for a Preliminary Examination before their national examinations.
<br>The school also monitors the academic progress of students using other
non-weighted assessments, such as project work and presentations.</p>
<p><strong>9. Are students expected to purchase a laptop for learning? </strong>

school student will be equipped with a personal learning device by the

school will be using devices of the same model and the purchasing of the
devices will be done in school. A separate briefing will be conducted later.</p>
<p><strong>10.&nbsp; How does the school support students to cope with the demands of the academic programmes? </strong>

consultations are provided for students when necessary.</p>

in the O Level Examinations, and about 90-95% of them are eligible for

MTL.</p>
<p><strong>14.&nbsp; If a student is enrolled into BPGHS via DSA Malay, what activities will he/she be expected to participate in? Must he/she join the Malay Cultural Society CCA and take Malay Literature subject for his/her O Level? </strong>
<br><strong>Answer:</strong> If a student enters our school via DSA Malay,
he/she will take Higher Malay Language (HML) as a subject and be part of
a comprehensive Elective Programme for Malay Language in Secondary Schools
(EMAS), just like other Express students taking HML in our school.</p>
<p>In addition, the school will be preparing the DSA Malay students for the
Malay Language Elective Programme (MLEP). The programme aims to nurture
promising students to attain a high level of language proficiency in Malay,
enhance their understanding of Malay literature and develop academically-able
students to become effectively bilingual so as to better serve the needs
of our nation. The 2-year programme (Secondary 3 and 4) is for students
who study ‘O’ Level Literature in Malay, in either full or elective. MLEP
activities include language and cultural camps, overseas immersion trips,
language symposiums and enrichment workshops on creative writing, drama
script writing, public speaking, translation and journalism.</p>
<p><strong>15.&nbsp; Does BPGHS have an Applied Learning Programme (ALP)? </strong>
<br><strong>Answer:</strong> BPGHS is an autonomous school, and thus we do
not offer ALP. However, all our students participate in our in-house Interdisciplinary
Project Work (IPW), which equips students with interdisciplinary problem-solving
skills and hones their collaborative and communication skills.</p>

<h4>STUDENT WELL-BEING</h4>

of students.</p>

<h4>CO-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES (CCA)</h4>
<p><strong>17.&nbsp; Is CCA compulsory in secondary schools?</strong>

<br>2. Sports and Games
<br>3. Performing Arts</p>
<p><strong>18.&nbsp; How much time does a student need to spend on CCA each week? </strong>

preparing for competitions. Generally, students can expect to participate
in 1-3 CCA sessions every week, with approximately 3 hours for each session.</p>
<p><strong>19.&nbsp; How is CCA allocated to each student? </strong>

talents and available vacancies.</p>

<h4>DISCIPLINE</h4>
<p><strong>20.&nbsp; What is the policy of the school on Personal Electronic Device (PED) usage in school?</strong>
<br><strong>Answer:</strong> Students are not encouraged to bring their PEDs
to school. If they choose to do so, they are personally responsible and
accountable for the safe-keeping of their PEDs, to prevent loss, damage
or theft.</p>
<p>Students are not allowed to wear smart watches to school to prevent distraction
during lessons. The school is a place set apart for conducive learning
to take place. Students should respect the place provided by upholding
the rules and guidelines that allow each and every student to learn effectively.</p>
