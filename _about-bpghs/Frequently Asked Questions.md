<p><strong>2. If I was not posted to BPGHS and wish to appeal into the school, how do I do so? </strong>
</p>
<p>Answer: Firstly, your PSLE score will have to meet the COP for BPGHS for
that posting group for the year. Secondly, there is a link in our Sec 1
Registration and Appeal website where there is a link for Appeals to be
filled up. The school will get back to you if there are successful appeal
applicants.</p>

<p><strong>3. My child is in Posting Group 3 and was posted to another school. Can my child appeal to join BPGHS with the other Posting Group 2 students?</strong>
</p>
<p>Answer: If your child is placed in Posting Group 3, he/she will not be
able to be placed in the Posting Group 2 of a secondary school. However,
if your child has the option to choose between Posting Group 2 and 3, then
he/she may appeal to join BPGHS as a Posting Group 2 student.</p>

all form classes will comprise of students from all Posting Groups. Secondly,
students in Posting Groups 1 and 2 will be offered the option to study
Humanities subjects at a more demanding level in Secondary 2, if they meet
the criteria.</p>
<p>You may find out more information on FSBB from the school website.</p>

have 1 weighted assessment in each term for Term 1-3, and an End- of-Year

be done in school. A separate briefing will be conducted later.</p>

<p><strong>14.&nbsp; If a student is enrolled into BPGHS via DSA Malay, what activities will he/she be expected to participate in? Must he/she join the Malay Cultural Society CCA and take Malay Literature subject for his/her O Level?</strong>
</p>
<p>Answer: If a student enters our school via DSA Malay, he/she will take
Higher Malay Language (HML) as a subject and be part of a comprehensive
Elective Programme for Malay Language in Secondary Schools (EMAS), just
like other Express students taking HML in our school.</p>
<p>In addition, the school will be preparing the DSA Malay students for the
Malay Language Elective Programme (MLEP). The programme aims to nurture
promising students to attain a high level of language proficiency in Malay,
enhance their understanding of Malay literature and develop academically-able
students to become effectively bilingual so as to better serve the needs
of our nation. The 2-year programme (Secondary 3 and 4) is for students
who study ‘O’ Level Literature in Malay, in either full or elective. MLEP
activities include language and cultural camps, overseas immersion trips,
language symposiums and enrichment workshops on creative writing, drama
script writing, public speaking, translation and journalism.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>15.&nbsp; Does BPGHS have an Applied Learning Programme (ALP)?</strong>
</p>
<p>Answer: BPGHS is an autonomous school, and thus we do not offer ALP. However,
all our students participate in our in-house Interdisciplinary Project
Work (IPW), which equips students with interdisciplinary problem-solving
skills and hones their collaborative and communication skills.</p>
<h4><u>STUDENT WELL-BEING</u></h4>
<p><strong>16.&nbsp; How does the school support students’ social and emotional well-being?</strong>
</p>
<p>Answer: The school has a student development team comprising Year Heads,
Assistant Year Heads, Special Education Needs Officer and a School Counsellor
working closely with the Form Teachers to look into the social and emotional
needs of students.</p>
<h4><u>CO-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES (CCA)</u></h4>
<p><strong>17.&nbsp; Is CCA compulsory in secondary schools?</strong>
</p>
<p>Answer: CCA is compulsory in secondary school. Students can choose a CCA
from one of the 3 categories:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uniformed Groups</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sports and Games</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Performing Arts</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>18.&nbsp; How much time does a student need to spend on CCA each week?</strong>Answer:
The frequency and duration of the CCA sessions vary from one to another.
These are likely to increase when students are preparing for competitions.
Generally, students can expect to participate in 1-3 CCA sessions every
week, with approximately 3 hours for each session.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>19.&nbsp; How is CCA allocated to each student? </strong>
</p>
<p>Answer: CCA allocation is based on students’ choices and talents and available
vacancies.</p>
<h4><u>DISCIPLINE</u></h4>
<p><strong>20.&nbsp; What is the policy of the school on Personal Electronic Device (PED) usage in school?</strong>
</p>
<p>Answer: Students are not encouraged to bring their PEDs to school. If
they choose to do so, they are personally responsible and accountable for
the safe-keeping of their PEDs, to prevent loss, damage or theft.</p>
<p>Students are not allowed to wear smart watches to school to prevent distraction
during lessons. The school is a place set apart for conducive learning
to take place. Students should respect the place provided by upholding
the rules and guidelines that allow each and every student to learn effectively.</p>
